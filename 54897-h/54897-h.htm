<p>Before all other things, man is distinguished by his pursuit and investigation
of <span class="smcap smaller">TRUTH</span>. And hence, when free from needful business and cares, we
delight to see, to hear, and to communicate, and consider a knowledge of
many admirable and abstruse things necessary to the good conduct and
happiness of our lives: whence it is clear that whatsoever is <span class="smcap smaller">TRUE</span>, simple,
and direct, the same is most congenial to our nature as men. Closely allied
with this earnest longing to see and know the truth, is a kind of dignified
and princely sentiment which forbids a mind, naturally well constituted, to
submit its faculties to any but those who announce it in precept or in doctrine,
or to yield obedience to any orders but such as are at once just,
lawful, and founded on utility. From this source spring greatness of mind
and contempt of worldly advantages and troubles.</p>

<p>OF MAN REGARDED AS A CREATURE OF INSTINCT, OF

SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS ON THE MIND.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">(1.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> situation of man on the globe he inhabits,
and over which he has obtained the control, is in
many respects exceedingly remarkable. Compared
with its other denizens, he seems, if we regard only
his physical constitution, in almost every respect
their inferior, and equally unprovided for the supply
of his natural wants and his defence against the innumerable
enemies which surround him. No other
animal passes so large a portion of its existence in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
state of absolute helplessness, or falls in old age into
such protracted and lamentable imbecility. To no
other warm-blooded animal has nature denied that
indispensable covering without which the vicissitudes
of a temperate and the rigours of a cold climate are
equally insupportable; and to scarcely any has she
been so sparing in external weapons, whether for
attack or defence. Destitute alike of speed to avoid
and of arms to repel the aggressions of his voracious
foes; tenderly susceptible of atmospheric influences;
and unfitted for the coarse aliments which
the earth affords spontaneously during at least two
thirds of the year, even in temperate climates,—man,
if abandoned to mere instinct, would be of all
creatures the most destitute and miserable. Distracted
by terror and goaded by famine; driven to
the most abject expedients for concealment from his
enemies, and to the most cowardly devices for the
seizure and destruction of his nobler prey, his existence
would be one continued subterfuge or stratagem;—his
dwelling would be in dens of the earth, in clefts
of rocks, or in the hollows of trees; his food worms,
and the lower reptiles, or such few and crude productions
of the soil as his organs could be brought
to assimilate, varied with occasional relics, mangled
by more powerful beasts of prey, or contemned by
their more pampered choice. Remarkable only
for the absence of those powers and qualities
which obtain for other animals a degree of security
and respect, he would be disregarded by some, and
hunted down by others, till after a few generations
his species would become altogether extinct, or, at
best, would be restricted to a few islands in tropical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
regions, where the warmth of the climate, the paucity
of enemies, and the abundance of vegetable food,
might permit it to linger.</p>

<p>(2.) Yet man is the undisputed lord of the creation.
The strongest and fiercest of his fellow-creatures,—the
whale, the elephant, the eagle, and
the tiger,—are slaughtered by him to supply his most
capricious wants, or tamed to do him service, or imprisoned
to make him sport. The spoils of all nature
are in daily requisition for his most common uses,
yielded with more or less readiness, or wrested
with reluctance, from the mine, the forest, the
ocean, and the air. Such are the first fruits of
reason. Were they the only or the principal ones,
were the mere acquisition of power over the materials,
and the less gifted animals which surround
us, and the consequent increase of our external
comforts, and our means of preservation and sensual
enjoyment, the sum of the privileges which the possession
of this faculty conferred, we should after all
have little to plume ourselves upon. But this is so far
from being the case, that every one who passes his life
in tolerable ease and comfort, or rather whose whole
time is not anxiously consumed in providing the absolute
necessaries of existence, is conscious of wants
and cravings in which the senses have no part, of a
series of pains and pleasures totally distinct in kind
from any which the infliction of bodily misery or the
gratification of bodily appetites has ever afforded him;
and if he has experienced these pleasures and these
pains in any degree of intensity, he will readily admit
them to hold a much higher rank, and to deserve much
more attention, than the former class. Independent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
the pleasures of fancy and imagination, and social converse,
man is constituted a speculative being; he contemplates
the world, and the objects around him, not
with a passive, indifferent gaze, as a set of phenomena
in which he has no further interest than as
they affect his immediate situation, and can be rendered
subservient to his comfort, but as a system
disposed with order and design. He approves and
feels the highest admiration for the harmony of its
parts, the skill and efficiency of its contrivances.
Some of these which he can best trace and understand
he attempts to imitate, and finds that to a
certain extent, though rudely and imperfectly, he
can succeed,—in others, that although he can comprehend
the nature of the contrivance, he is totally
destitute of all means of imitation;—while in others,
again, and those evidently the most important, though
he sees the effect produced, yet the means by which
it is done are alike beyond his knowledge and his
control. Thus he is led to the conception of a
Power and an Intelligence superior to his own, and
adequate to the production and maintenance of all
that he sees in nature,—a Power and Intelligence
to which he may well apply the term infinite, since
he not only sees no actual limit to the instances in
which they are manifested, but finds, on the contrary,
that the farther he enquires, and the wider
his sphere of observation extends, they continually
open upon him in increasing abundance; and that
as the study of one prepares him to understand
and appreciate another, refinement follows on refinement,
wonder on wonder, till his faculties
become bewildered in admiration, and his intellect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
falls back on itself in utter hopelessness of arriving
at an end.</p>

<p>(3.) When from external objects he turns his view
upon himself, on his own vital and intellectual faculties,
he finds that he possesses a power of examining
and analysing his own nature to a certain
extent, but no farther. In his corporeal frame he is
sensible of a power to communicate a certain moderate
amount of motion to himself and other objects;
that this power depends on his will, and that its exertion
can be suspended or increased at pleasure
within certain limits; but <em>how</em> his will acts on his
limbs he has no consciousness: and whence he derives
the power he thus exercises, there is nothing to
assure him, however he may long to know. His
senses, too, inform him of a multitude of particulars
respecting the external world, and he perceives an
apparatus by which impressions from without may be
transmitted, as a sort of signals to the interior of his
person, and ultimately to his brain, wherein he is
obscurely sensible that the thinking, feeling, reasoning
being he calls <em>himself</em>, more especially resides;
but by what means he becomes conscious of these
impressions, and what is the nature of the immediate
communication between that inward sentient being,
and that machinery, his outward man, he has not
the slightest conception.</p>

<p>(4.) Again, when he contemplates still more
attentively the thoughts, acts, and passions of this
his sentient intelligent self, he finds, indeed, that
he can remember, and by the aid of memory can
compare and discriminate, can judge and resolve,
and, above all, that he is irresistibly impelled, from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the perception of any phenomenon without or within
him, to infer the existence of something prior which
stands to it in the relation of a <em>cause</em>, without which
it would not be, and that this knowledge of causes
and their consequences is what, in almost every instance,
determines his choice and will, in cases where
he is nevertheless conscious of perfect freedom to
act or not to act. He finds, too, that it is in his
power to acquire more or less knowledge of causes
and effects according to the degree of attention he
bestows upon them, which attention is again in great
measure a voluntary act; and often when his choice
has been decided on imperfect knowledge or insufficient
attention, he finds reason to correct his judgment,
though perhaps too late to influence his decision
by after consideration. A world within him is
thus opened to his intellectual view, abounding with
phenomena and relations, and of the highest immediate
interest. But while he cannot help perceiving
that the insight he is enabled to obtain into this internal
sphere of thought and feeling is in reality the source
of all his power, the very fountain of his predominance
over external nature, he yet feels himself capable of
entering only very imperfectly into these recesses of
his own bosom, and analysing the operations of his
mind,—in this as in all other things, in short, “<em>a being
darkly wise</em>;” seeing that all the longest life and most
vigorous intellect can give him power to discover by
his own research, or time to know by availing himself
of that of others, serves only to place him on
the very frontier of knowledge, and afford a distant
glimpse of boundless realms beyond, where no human
thought has penetrated, but which yet he is sure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
must be no less familiarly known to that Intelligence
which he traces throughout creation than the most
obvious truths which he himself daily applies to his
most trifling purposes. Is it wonderful that a being
so constituted should first encourage a hope, and by
degrees acknowledge an assurance, that his intellectual
existence will not terminate with the
dissolution of his corporeal frame, but rather that in
a future state of being, disencumbered of a thousand
obstructions which his present situation throws in
his way, endowed with acuter senses, and higher faculties,
he shall drink deep at that fountain of beneficent
wisdom for which the slight taste obtained on
earth has given him so keen a relish?</p>

<p>(5.) Nothing, then, can be more unfounded than
the objection which has been taken, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in limine</i>,
by persons, well meaning perhaps, certainly narrow-minded,
against the study of natural philosophy,
and indeed against all science,—that it fosters in its
cultivators an undue and overweening self-conceit,
leads them to doubt the immortality of the soul, and
to scoff at revealed religion. Its natural effect, we
may confidently assert, on every well constituted
mind is and must be the direct contrary. No doubt,
the testimony of natural reason, on whatever exercised,
must of necessity stop short of those truths
which it is the object of revelation to make known;
but, while it places the existence and principal attributes
of a Deity on such grounds as to render doubt
impossible, it unquestionably opposes no natural or
necessary obstacle to further progress: on the contrary,
by cherishing as a vital principle an unbounded
spirit of enquiry, and ardency of expectation, it unfetters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
the mind from prejudices of every kind, and
leaves it open and free to every impression of a higher
nature which it is susceptible of receiving, guarding
only against enthusiasm and self-deception by a
habit of strict investigation, but encouraging, rather
than suppressing, every thing that can offer a prospect
or a hope beyond the present obscure and
unsatisfactory state. The character of the true
philosopher is to hope all things not impossible,
and to believe all things not unreasonable. He
who has seen obscurities which appeared impenetrable
in physical and mathematical science suddenly
dispelled, and the most barren and unpromising
fields of enquiry converted, as if by inspiration,
into rich and inexhaustible springs of knowledge
and power on a simple change of our point of view,
or by merely bringing to bear on them some principle
which it never occurred before to try, will
surely be the very last to acquiesce in any dispiriting
prospects of either the present or future destinies
of mankind; while, on the other hand, the
boundless views of intellectual and moral as well as
material relations which open on him on all hands
in the course of these pursuits, the knowledge of
the trivial place he occupies in the scale of creation,
and the sense continually pressed upon him of his
own weakness and incapacity to suspend or modify
the slightest movement of the machinery he sees in
action around him, must effectually convince him
that humility of pretension, no less than confidence
of hope, is what best becomes his character.</p>

<p>(6.) But while we thus vindicate the study of natural
philosophy from a charge at one time formidable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
owing to the pertinacity and acrimony with
which it was urged, and still occasionally brought
forward to the distress and disgust of every well
constituted mind, we must take care that the testimony
afforded by science to religion, be its extent or
value what it may, shall be at least independent,
unbiassed, and spontaneous. We do not here allude
to such reasoners as would make all nature bend to
their narrow interpretations of obscure and difficult
passages in the sacred writings: such a course might
well become the persecutors of Galileo and the other
bigots of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but
can only be adopted by dreamers in the present age.
But, without going these lengths, it is no uncommon
thing to find persons, earnestly attached to science
and anxious for its promotion, who yet manifest a morbid
sensibility on points of this kind,—who exult and
applaud when any fact starts up explanatory (as they
suppose) of some scriptural allusion and who feel
pained and disappointed when the general course
of discovery in any department of science runs wide
of the notions with which particular passages in the
Bible may have impressed themselves. To persons
of such a frame of mind it ought to suffice to
remark, on the one hand, that truth can never be opposed
to truth, and, on the other, that error is only
to be effectually confounded by searching deep and
tracing it to its source. Nevertheless, it were much
to be wished that such persons, estimable and excellent
as many of them are, before they throw
the weight of their applause or discredit into
the scale of scientific opinion on such grounds,
would reflect, first, that the credit and respectability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of <em>any</em> evidence may be destroyed by
tampering with its <em>honesty</em>; and, secondly, that this
very disposition of mind implies a lurking mistrust
in its own principles, since the grand and indeed
only character of truth is its capability of enduring
the test of universal experience, and coming unchanged
out of every possible form of <em>fair</em> discussion.</p>

<p>(7.) But if science may be vilified by representing
it as opposed to religion, or trammelled by mistaken
notions of the danger of free enquiry, there
is yet another mode by which it may be degraded
from its native dignity, and that is by placing it in
the light of a mere appendage to and caterer for our
pampered appetites. The question “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cui bono</i>” to
what practical end and advantage do your researches
tend? is one which the speculative philosopher who
loves knowledge for its own sake, and enjoys, as a
rational being should enjoy, the mere contemplation
of harmonious and mutually dependent truths, can
seldom hear without a sense of humiliation. He
feels that there is a lofty and disinterested pleasure
in his speculations which ought to exempt them
from such questioning; communicating as they do
to his own mind the purest happiness (after the
exercise of the benevolent and moral feelings) of
which human nature is susceptible, and tending to
the injury of no one, he might surely allege <em>this</em> as
a sufficient and direct reply to those who, having
themselves little capacity, and less relish for intellectual
pursuits, are constantly repeating upon him
this enquiry. But if he can bring himself to
descend from this high but fair ground, and justify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
himself, his pursuits, and his pleasures in the eyes
of those around him, he has only to point to the
history of all science, where speculations, apparently
unprofitable, have, in innumerable instances,
been those from which great practical applications
have emanated. What, for instance, could be
more so than the dry speculations of the ancient
geometers on the properties of the conic sections,
or than the dreams of Kepler (as they would naturally
appear to his contemporaries) about the
numerical harmonies of the universe? Yet these
are the steps by which we have risen to a knowledge
of the elliptic motions of the planets and the
law of gravitation, with all its splendid theoretical
consequences, and its inestimable practical results.
The ridicule attached to “<em>Swing-swangs</em>” in
Hooke’s time<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> did not prevent him from reviving
the proposal of the <em>pendulum</em> as a standard of
measure, since so effectually wrought into practice
by the genius and perseverance of Captain Kater;—nor
did that which Boyle encountered in his
researches on the elasticity and pressure of the air
act as any obstacle to the train of discovery which
terminated in the steam-engine. The dreams of
the alchemists led them on in the path of experiment,
and drew attention to the wonders of
chemistry, while they brought their advocates (it
must be admitted) to merited contempt and ruin.
But in this case it was moral dereliction which gave
to ridicule a weight and power not necessarily or
naturally belonging to it: but among the alchemists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
were men of superior minds, who reasoned while they
worked, and who, not content to grope always in the
dark, and blunder on their object, sought carefully
in the observed nature of their agents for guides in
their pursuit. To these we owe the creation of
experimental philosophy.</p>

<p>(8.) Not that it is meant, by any thing above
said, to assert that there is no such thing as a great
or a little in speculative philosophy, or to place the
solution of an enigma on a level with the developement
of a law of nature, still less to adopt the
homely definition of Smith<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, that a philosopher is
a person whose trade it is to do nothing, and speculate
on every thing. The speculations of the natural
philosopher, however remote they may for a
time lead him from beaten tracks and every-day
uses, being grounded in the realities of nature, have
all, of necessity, a practical application,—nay more,
such applications form the very criterions of their
truth, they afford the readiest and completest verifications
of his theories;—verifications which he
will no more neglect to test them by than an arithmetician
would omit to <em>prove</em> his sums, or a cautious
geometer to try his general theorems by particular
cases.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
(9.) After all, however, it must be confessed,
that to minds unacquainted with science, and unused
to consider the mutual dependencies of its various
branches, there is something neither unnatural nor
altogether blamable in the ready occurrence of this
question of direct advantage. It requires some
habit of abstraction, some penetration of the mind
with a tincture of scientific enquiry, some conviction
of the value of those estimable and treasured
principles which lie concealed in the most
common and homely facts,—some experience, in
fine, of success in developing and placing them in
evidence, announcing them in precise terms, and
applying them to the explanation of other facts of a
less familiar character, or to the accomplishment of
some obviously useful purpose:—to cure the mind
of this tendency to rush at once upon its object,
to undervalue the means in over-estimation of the
end, and while gazing too intently at the goal which
alone it has been accustomed to desire, to lose sight
of the richness and variety of the prospects that
offer themselves on either hand on the road.</p>

<p>(10.) We must never forget that it is principles,
not phenomena,—the interpretation, not the mere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
knowledge of facts,—which are the objects of enquiry
to the natural philosopher. As truth is single,
and consistent with itself, a principle may be as
completely and as plainly elucidated by the most
familiar and simple fact, as by the most imposing and
uncommon phenomenon. The colours which glitter
on a soap-bubble are the immediate consequence of
a principle the most important from the variety of
phenomena it explains, and the most beautiful, from
its simplicity and compendious neatness, in the whole
science of optics. If the nature of periodical colours
can be made intelligible by the contemplation of
such a trivial object, from that moment it becomes a
noble instrument in the eye of correct judgment;
and to blow a large, regular, and durable soap-bubble
may become the serious and praiseworthy endeavour
of a sage, while children stand round and scoff, or
children of a larger growth hold up their hands in
astonishment at such waste of time and trouble.
To the natural philosopher there is no natural
object unimportant or trifling. From the least of
nature’s works he may learn the greatest lessons.
The fall of an apple to the ground may raise his
thoughts to the laws which govern the revolutions
of the planets in their orbits; or the situation of a
pebble may afford him evidence of the state of the
globe he inhabits, myriads of ages ago, before his
species became its denizens.</p>

<p>(11.) And this is, in fact, one of the great sources
of delight which the study of natural science imparts
to its votaries. A mind which has once imbibed a
taste for scientific enquiry, and has learnt the habit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of applying its principles readily to the cases which
occur, has within itself an inexhaustible source of
pure and exciting contemplations:—one would
think that Shakspeare had such a mind in view when
he describes a contemplative man as finding all nature
eloquent—the very trees, the brooks, and the
stones reading to him lessons of deep and serious import.
Accustomed to trace the operation of general
causes, and the exemplification of general laws, in
circumstances where the uninformed and unenquiring
eye perceives neither novelty nor beauty, he
walks in the midst of wonders: every object which
falls in his way elucidates some principle, affords
some instruction, and impresses him with a sense of
harmony and order. Nor is it a mere passive pleasure
which is thus communicated. A thousand
questions are continually arising in his mind, a
thousand subjects of enquiry presenting themselves,
which keep his faculties in constant exercise, and
his thoughts perpetually on the wing, so that lassitude
is excluded from his life, and that craving
after artificial excitement and dissipation of mind,
which leads so many into frivolous, unworthy, and
destructive pursuits, is altogether eradicated from
his bosom.</p>

<p>(12.) It is not one of the least advantages of these
pursuits, which, however, they possess in common
with every class of intellectual pleasures, that they
are altogether independent of external circumstances,
and are to be enjoyed in every situation in
which a man can be placed in life. The highest degrees
of worldly prosperity are so far from being incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
with them, that they supply inestimable
advantages for their pursuit, and that sort of fresh
and renewed relish which arises partly from the
sense of contrast, partly from experience of the
peculiar pre-eminence they possess over the pleasures
of sense in their capability of unlimited increase
and continual repetition without satiety or
distaste. They may be enjoyed, too, in the intervals
of the most active business; and the calm
and dispassionate interest with which they fill the
mind renders them a most delightful retreat from
the agitations and dissensions of the world, and
from the conflict of passions, prejudices, and interests
in which the man of business finds himself involved.
There is something in the contemplation
of general laws which powerfully induces and persuades
us to merge individual feeling, and to commit
ourselves unreservedly to their disposal; while the
observation of the calm, energetic regularity of nature,
the immense scale of her operations, and the
certainty with which her ends are attained, tends,
irresistibly, to tranquillize and re-assure the mind,
and render it less accessible to repining, selfish, and
turbulent emotions. And this it does, not by debasing
our nature into weak compliances and abject
submission to circumstances, but by filling us, as
from an inward spring, with a sense of nobleness
and power which enables us to rise superior to them;
by showing us our strength and innate dignity, and
by calling upon us for the exercise of those powers
and faculties by which we are susceptible of the
comprehension of so much greatness, and which
form, as it were, a link between ourselves and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
best and noblest benefactors of our species, with
whom we hold communion in thoughts and participate
in discoveries which have raised them above
their fellow-mortals, and brought them nearer to
their Creator.</p>

<p class="in0">(13.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">S</span>cience</span> is the knowledge of many, orderly
and methodically digested and arranged, so as to
become attainable by one. The knowledge of reasons
and their conclusions constitutes <em>abstract</em>, that of
causes and their effects, and of the laws of nature,
<em>natural science</em>.</p>

<p>(14.) Abstract science is independent of a system
of nature,—of a creation,—of every thing, in short,
except memory, thought, and reason. Its objects
are, first, those primary existences and relations
which we cannot even conceive not to <em>be</em>, such as
space, time, number, order, &amp;c.; and, secondly,
those artificial forms, or symbols, which thought
has the power of creating for itself at pleasure,
and substituting as representatives, by the aid of
memory, for combinations of those primary objects
and of its own conceptions,—either to facilitate the
act of reasoning respecting them, or as convenient
deposits of its own conclusions, or for their communication
to others. Such are, first, <em>language</em>,
oral or written; its conventional forms, which constitute
grammar, and the rules for its use in argument,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
in which consists the logic of the schools; secondly,
<em>notation</em>, which, applied to <em>number</em>, is <em>arithmetic</em>,—and,
to the more general relations of abstract quantity
or order, is <em>algebra</em>; and, thirdly, that higher
kind of logic, which teaches us to use our reason in
the most advantageous manner for the discovery of
truth; which points out the criterions by which we
may be sure we have attained it; and which, by
detecting the sources of error, and exposing the
haunts where fallacies are apt to lurk, at once warns
us of their danger, and shows us how to avoid them.
This greater logic may be termed <em>rational</em><a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>; while,
to that inferior department which is conversant with
words alone, the epithet <em>verbal</em><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> may, for distinction,
be applied.</p>

<p>(15.) A certain moderate degree of acquaintance
with abstract science is highly desirable to every
one who would make any considerable progress in
physics. As the universe exists in time and place;
and as motion, velocity, quantity, number, and
order, are main elements of our knowledge of external
things and their changes, an acquaintance
with these, abstractedly considered, (that is to say,
independent of any consideration of the particular
things moved, measured, counted, or arranged,)
must evidently be a useful preparation for the more
complex study of nature. But there is yet another
recommendation of such sciences as a preparation
for the study of natural philosophy. Their objects
are so definite, and our notions of them so distinct,
that we can reason about them with an assurance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
that the words and signs used in our reasonings
are full and true representatives of the things signified;
and, consequently, that when we use language
or signs in argument, we neither, by their
use, introduce extraneous notions, nor exclude any
part of the case before us from consideration. For
example: the words space, square, circle, a hundred,
&amp;c., convey to the mind notions so complete in
themselves, and so distinct from every thing else,
that we are sure when we use them we know and
have in view the whole of our own meaning. It is
widely different with words expressing natural objects
and mixed relations. Take, for instance, iron.
Different persons attach very different ideas to this
word. One who has never heard of magnetism has
a widely different notion of <em>iron</em> from one in the
contrary predicament. The vulgar, who regard this
metal as incombustible, and the chemist, who sees
it burn with the utmost fury, and who has other
reasons for regarding it as one of the most combustible
bodies in nature;—the poet, who uses it as
an emblem of rigidity; and the smith and engineer,
in whose hands it is plastic, and moulded like wax
into every form;—the jailer, who prizes it as an
obstruction, and the electrician, who sees in it only a
channel of open communication by which that most
impassable of obstacles, the air, may be traversed
by his imprisoned fluid, have all different, and all
imperfect, notions of the same word. The meaning
of such a term is like a rainbow—every body sees a
different one, and all maintain it to be the same.
So it is with nearly all our terms of sense. Some
are indefinite, as hard or soft, light or heavy (terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
which were at one time the sources of innumerable
mistakes and controversies); some excessively complex,
as man, life, instinct. But, what is worst of
all, some, nay most, have two or three meanings;
sufficiently distinct from each other to make a proposition
true in one sense and false in another, or
even false altogether; yet not distinct enough to
keep us from confounding them in the process by
which we arrived at it, or to enable us immediately
to recognise the fallacy when led to it by a train of
reasoning, each step of which we <em>think</em> we have
examined and approved. Surely those who thus
attach two senses to one word, or superadd a new
meaning to an old one, act as absurdly as colonists
who distribute themselves over the world, naming
every place they come to by the names of those
they have left, till all distinctions of geographical
nomenclature are confounded, and till we are unable
to decide whether an occurrence stated to have
happened at Windsor took place in Europe, America,
or Australia.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>(16.) It is, in fact, in this double or incomplete sense
of words that we must look for the origin of a very
large portion of the errors into which we fall. Now,
the study of the abstract sciences, such as arithmetic,
geometry, algebra, &amp;c., while they afford scope for
the exercise of reasoning about objects that are, or,
at least, may be conceived to be, external to us;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
yet, being free from these sources of error and mistake,
accustom us to the strict use of language as
an instrument of reason, and by familiarizing us, in
our progress towards truth, to walk uprightly and
straight-forward on firm ground, give us that proper
and dignified carriage of mind which could never be
acquired by having always to pick our steps among
obstructions and loose fragments, or to steady them
in the reeling tempest of conflicting meanings.</p>

<p id="p17">(17.) But there is yet another point of view under
which some acquaintance with abstract science may
be regarded as highly desirable in general education,
if not indispensably necessary, to impress
on us the distinction between strict and vague
reasoning, to show us what demonstration really
<em>is</em>, and to give us thereby a full and intimate sense
of the nature and strength of the evidence on
which our knowledge of the actual system of nature,
and the laws of natural phenomena, rests. For this
purpose, however, a very moderate acquaintance
with the more elementary branches of mathematics
may suffice. The chain is laid before us, and every
link is submitted to our unreserved examination, if
we have patience and inclination to enter on such
detail. Hundreds have gone through it, and will
continue to do so; but, for the generality of mankind,
it is enough to satisfy themselves of the solidity
and adamantine texture of its materials, and
the unreserved exposure of its weakest, as well as
its strongest, parts. If, however, we content ourselves
with this general view of the matter, we
must be content also to take on trust, that is, on
the authority of those who have examined deeper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
every conclusion which cannot be made apparent to
our senses. Now, among these there are many so
very surprising, indeed apparently so extravagant,
that it is quite impossible for any enquiring mind
to rest contented with a mere hearsay statement of
them,—we feel irresistibly impelled to enquire further
into their truth. What mere assertion will
make any man believe, that in one second of time,
in one beat of the pendulum of a clock, a ray of
light travels over 192,000 miles, and would therefore
perform the tour of the world in about the
same time that it requires to wink with our eyelids,
and in much less than a swift runner occupies in
taking a single stride? What mortal can be made
to believe, without demonstration, that the sun is
almost a million times larger than the earth? and
that, although so remote from us, that a cannon ball
shot directly towards it, and maintaining its full
speed, would be twenty years in reaching it, it yet
affects the earth by its attraction in an inappreciable
instant of time?—a closeness of union of which
we can form but a feeble, and totally inadequate,
idea, by comparing it to any material connection;
since the communication of an impulse to
such a distance, by any solid intermedium we are
acquainted with, would require, not moments, but
whole years. And when, with pain and difficulty
we have strained our imagination to conceive a distance
so vast, a force so intense and penetrating, if
we are told that the one dwindles to an insensible
point, and the other is unfelt at the nearest of the
fixed stars, from the mere effect of their remoteness,
while among those very stars are some whose actual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
splendour exceeds by many hundred times that of the
sun itself, although we may not deny the truth of
the assertion, we cannot but feel the keenest curiosity
to know <em>how</em> such things were ever made out.</p>

<p>(18.) The foregoing are among those results of
scientific research which, by their magnitude, seem
to transcend our powers of conception. There are
others, again, which, from their minuteness, would
appear to elude the grasp of thought, much more of
distinct and accurate measurement. Who would not
ask for demonstration, when told that a gnat’s wing,
in its ordinary flight, beats many hundred times in a
second? or that there exist animated and regularly
organized beings, many thousands of whose bodies
laid close together would not extend an inch? But
what are these to the astonishing truths which
modern optical enquiries have disclosed, which teach
us that every point of a medium through which a ray
of light passes is affected with a succession of periodical
movements, regularly recurring at equal intervals,
no less than five hundred millions of millions of times
in a single second! that it is by such movements,
communicated to the nerves of our eyes, that we
see:—nay more, that it is the <em>difference</em> in the frequency
of their recurrence which affects us with the
sense of the diversity of colour; that, for instance,
in acquiring the sensation of redness our eyes are
affected four hundred and eighty-two millions of
millions of times; of yellowness, five hundred and
forty-two millions of millions of times; and of violet,
seven hundred and seven millions of millions of times
per second.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Do not such things sound more like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
the ravings of madmen, than the sober conclusions of
people in their waking senses?</p>

<p>(19.) They are, nevertheless, conclusions to which
any one may most certainly arrive, who will only
be at the trouble of examining the chain of reasoning
by which they have been deduced; but, in order to
do this, something beyond the mere elements of abstract
science is required. Waving, however, such
instances as these, which, after all, are rather calculated
to surprise and astound than for any other purpose,
it must be observed that it is not possible to
satisfy ourselves completely that we <em>have</em> arrived at
a true statement of any law of nature, until, setting
out from such statement, and making it a foundation
of reasoning, we can show, by strict argument, that
the facts observed must follow from it as necessary
logical consequences, and <em>this</em>, not vaguely and generally,
but with all possible precision in time, place,
weight, and measure.</p>

<p>(20.) To do this, however, as we shall presently
see, requires in many cases a degree of knowledge of
mathematics and geometry altogether unattainable by
the generality of mankind, who have not the leisure,
even if they all had the capacity, to enter into such
enquiries, some of which are indeed of that degree of
difficulty that they can be only successfully prosecuted
by persons who devote to them their whole
attention, and make them the serious business of
their lives. But there is scarcely any person of
good ordinary understanding, however little exercised
in abstract enquiries, who may not be readily
made to comprehend at least the general train of
reasoning by which any of the great truths of physics<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
are deduced, and the essential bearings and connections
of the several parts of natural philosophy.
There are whole branches too and very extensive
and important ones, to which mathematical reasoning
has never been at all applied; such as chemistry,
geology, and natural history in general, and many
others, in which it plays a very subordinate part, and
of which the essential principles, and the grounds of
application to useful purposes, may be perfectly well
understood by a student who possesses no more
mathematical knowledge than the rules of arithmetic;
so that no one need be deterred from the
acquisition of knowledge, or even from active original
research in such subjects, by a want of mathematical
information. Even in those branches which,
like astronomy, optics, and dynamics, are almost exclusively
under the dominion of mathematics, and in
which no effectual progress can be made without
<em>some</em> acquaintance with geometry, the principal
<em>results</em> may be perfectly understood without it. To
one incapable of following out the intricacies of
mathematical demonstration, the conviction afforded
by verified predictions must stand in the place of
that purer and more satisfactory reliance which a
verification of every step in the process of reasoning
can alone afford, since every one will acknowledge
the validity of pretensions which he is in the daily
habit of seeing brought to the test of practice.</p>

<p>(21.) Among the verifications of this practical
kind which abound in every department of physics,
there are none more imposing than the precise prediction
of the greater phenomena of astronomy;
none, certainly, which carry a broader conviction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
home to every mind from their notoriety and unequivocal
character. The prediction of eclipses has
accordingly from the earliest ages excited the admiration
of mankind, and been one grand instrument
by which their allegiance (so to speak) to natural
science, and their respect for its professors, has been
maintained; and though strangely abused in unenlightened
ages by the supernatural pretensions of
astrologers, the credence given even to their absurdities
shows the force of this kind of evidence on
men’s minds. The predictions of astronomers are,
however, now far too familiar to endanger the just
equipoise of our judgment, since even the return of
comets, true to their paths and exact to the hour
of their appointment, has ceased to amaze, though
it must ever delight all who have souls capable of
being penetrated by such beautiful instances of accordance
between theory and facts. But the age of
mere wonder in such things is past, and men prefer
being guided and enlightened, to being astonished
and dazzled. Eclipses, comets, and the like, afford
but rare and transient displays of the powers of calculation,
and of the certainty of the principles on
which it is grounded. A page of “lunar distances”
from the Nautical Almanack is worth all the eclipses
that have ever happened for inspiring this necessary
confidence in the conclusions of science. That a
man, by merely measuring the moon’s apparent distance
from a star with a little portable instrument
held in his hand, and applied to his eye, even with
so unstable a footing as the deck of a ship, shall say
positively, within five miles, where he is, on a boundless
ocean, cannot but appear to persons ignorant of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
physical astronomy an approach to the miraculous.
Yet, the alternatives of life and death, wealth and
ruin, are daily and hourly staked with perfect confidence
on these marvellous computations, which
might almost seem to have been devised on purpose
to show how closely the extremes of speculative
refinement and practical utility can be brought to
approximate. We have before us an anecdote communicated
to us by a naval officer<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>, distinguished for
the extent and variety of his attainments, which
shows how impressive such results may become in
practice. He sailed from San Blas on the west
coast of Mexico, and after a voyage of 8000 miles,
occupying 89 days, arrived off Rio de Janeiro, having,
in this interval, passed through the Pacific
Ocean, rounded Cape Horn, and crossed the South
Atlantic, without making any land, or even seeing a
single sail, with the exception of an American whaler
off Cape Horn. Arrived within a week’s sail of Rio,
he set seriously about determining, by lunar observations,
the precise line of the ship’s course and its
situation in it at a determinate moment, and having
ascertained this within from five to ten miles, ran the
rest of the way by those more ready and compendious
methods, known to navigators, which can be
safely employed for short trips between one known
point and another, but which cannot be trusted in
long voyages, where the moon is the only sure guide.
The rest of the tale we are enabled by his kindness
to state in his own words:—“We steered towards
Rio de Janeiro for some days after taking the lunars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
above described, and having arrived within fifteen or
twenty miles of the coast, I hove to at four in the
morning till the day should break, and then bore up;
for although it was very hazy, we could see before
us a couple of miles or so. About eight o’clock it
became so foggy that I did not like to stand in farther,
and was just bringing the ship to the wind
again before sending the people to breakfast, when
it suddenly cleared off, and I had the satisfaction of
seeing the great Sugar Loaf Rock, which stands on
one side of the harbour’s mouth, so nearly right
ahead that we had not to alter our course above a
point in order to hit the entrance of Rio. This was
the first land we had seen for three months, after
crossing so many seas and being set backwards and
forwards by innumerable currents and foul winds.”
The effect on all on board might well be conceived
to have been electric; and it is needless to remark
how essentially the authority of a commanding
officer over his crew may be strengthened by the
occurrence of such incidents, indicative of a degree
of knowledge and consequent power beyond their
reach.</p>

<p>(22.) But even such results as these, striking as
they are, yet fall short of the force with which conviction
is urged upon us when, through the medium
of reasoning too abstract for common apprehension,
we arrive at conclusions which outrun experience,
and describe beforehand what will happen under
new combinations, or even correct imperfect experiments,
and lead us to a knowledge of facts contrary
to received analogies drawn from an experience
wrongly interpreted or overhastily generalised. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
give an example:—every body knows that objects
viewed through a transparent medium, such as water
or glass, appear distorted or displaced. Thus, a stick
in water appears bent, and an object seen through a
prism or wedge of glass seems to be thrown aside
from its true place. This effect is owing to what is
called the <em>refraction</em> of light; and a simple rule discovered
by Willebrod Snell enables any one to say
exactly <em>how much</em> the stick will be bent, and <em>how
far</em>, and in what <em>direction</em>, the apparent situation of
an object seen through the glass will deviate from the
real one. If a shilling be laid at the bottom of a
basin of water and viewed obliquely, it will appear
to be raised by the water; if instead of water spirits
of wine be used it will appear more raised; if oil, still
more:—but in none of these cases will it appear to
be thrown <em>aside</em> to the <em>right</em> or <em>left</em> of its true place,
however the eye be situated. The <em>plane</em>, in which
are contained the eye, the object, and the point in
the surface of the liquid at which the object is seen,
is an upright or <em>vertical</em> plane; and this is one of the
principal characters in the <em>ordinary refraction</em> of light,
viz. that the ray by which we see an object through a
refracting surface, although it undergoes a bending,
and is, as it were, broken at the surface, yet, in pursuing
its course to the eye, does not <em>quit a plane
perpendicular to the refracting surface</em>. But there
are again other substances, such as rock-crystal, and
especially Iceland spar, which possess the singular
property of <em>doubling</em> the image or appearance of an
object seen through them in certain directions; so
that instead of seeing one object we see two, side by
side, when such a crystal or spar is interposed between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the object and the eye; and if a ray or small
sunbeam be thrown upon a surface of either of these
substances, it will be split into two, making an angle
with each other, and each pursuing its own separate
course,—this is called <em>double refraction</em>. Now, of
these images or doubly refracted rays, one always
follows the same rule as if the substance were glass
or water: its deviation can be correctly calculated
by Snell’s law above mentioned, and it does not quit
the plane perpendicular to the refracting surface.
The other ray, on the contrary, (which is therefore
said to have undergone <em>extraordinary refraction</em>) <em>does</em>
quit that plane, and the amount of its deviation from
its former course requires for its determination a
much more complicated rule, which cannot be understood
or even stated without a pretty intimate
knowledge of geometry. Now, rock-crystal and
Iceland spar differ from glass in a very remarkable
circumstance. They affect naturally certain regular
figures, not being found in shapeless lumps, but in
determinate geometrical forms; and they are susceptible
of being cleft or split much easier in certain
directions than in others—they have a <em>grain</em> which
glass has not. When other substances having this
peculiarity (and which are called <em>crystallized</em> substances)
were examined, they were all, or by far the
greater part, found to possess this singular property
of <em>double refraction</em>; and it was very natural to conclude,
therefore, that the same thing took place in
all of them, viz. that of the two rays, into which any
beam of light falling on the surface of such a substance
was split, or of the two images of an object
seen through it, <em>one</em> only was turned aside out of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
<em>plane</em> and <em>extraordinarily</em> refracted, while the other
followed the <em>ordinary</em> rule. Accordingly this was
supposed to be the case; and not only so, but from
some trials and measurements purposely made by a
philosopher of great eminence, it was considered to
be a fact sufficiently established by experiment.</p>

<p>(23.) Perhaps we might have remained long under
this impression, for the measurements are delicate,
and the subject very difficult. But it has lately
been demonstrated by an eminent French philosopher
and mathematician, M. Fresnel, that, granting certain
<em>principles</em> or postulates, all the phenomena of double
refraction, including perhaps the greatest variety of
facts that have ever yet been arranged under one
general head, may be satisfactorily explained and
deduced from them by strict mathematical calculation;
and <em>that</em>, when applied to the cases first mentioned,
these principles give a satisfactory account
of the <em>want</em> of the extraordinary image; <em>that</em> when
applied to such cases as those of rock-crystal or Iceland
spar, they also give a correct account of both
the images, and agree in their conclusions with the
rules before ascertained for them: but so far from
coinciding with that part of the previous statement,
which would make these conclusions extend to all
crystallised substances, M. Fresnel’s principles lead
to a conclusion quite opposite, and point to a <em>fact</em>
which had never been observed, viz. that in by far
the greater number of crystallized substances which
possess the property of double refraction, <em>neither</em> of
the images follows the ordinary law, but both undergo
a deviation from their original plane. Now
this had never been observed to be the case in any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
previous trial, and all opinion was against it. But
when put to the test of experiment in a great variety
of new and ingenious methods, it was found to be
fully verified; and to complete the evidence, the substances
on whose imperfect examination the first
erroneous conclusion was founded, having been
lately subjected to a fresh and more scrupulous
examination, the result has shown the insufficiency
of the former measurements, and proved in perfect
accordance with the newly discovered laws. Now
it will be observed in this case, first, that, so far from
the principles assumed by M. Fresnel being at all
obvious, they are extremely remote from ordinary
observation; and, secondly, that the chain of reasoning
by which they are brought to the test is one
of such length and complexity, and the purely mathematical
difficulty of their application so great, that
no <em>mere</em> good common sense, no general tact or ordinary
practical reasoning, would afford the slightest
chance of threading their mazes. Cases like this
are the triumph of theories. They show at once
how large a part pure reason has to perform in our
examination of nature, and how implicit our reliance
ought to be on that powerful and methodical system
of rules and processes which constitute the modern
mathematical analysis, in all the more difficult applications
of exact calculation to her phenomena.</p>

<p>(24.) To take an instance more within ordinary apprehension.
An eminent living geometer had proved
by calculations, founded on strict optical principles,
that in the <em>centre of the shadow</em> of a small circular
plate of metal, exposed in a dark room to a beam of
light emanating from a <em>very small brilliant point</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
there ought to be no darkness,—in fact, <em>no shadow</em>
at that place; but, on the contrary, a degree of illumination
precisely as bright as if the metal plate
were away. Strange and even impossible as this
conclusion may seem, it has been put to the trial,
and found perfectly correct.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p class="in0">(26.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> first thing impressed on us from our
earliest infancy is, that events do not succeed one
another at random, but with a certain degree of order,
regularity, and connection;—some constantly, and,
as we are apt to think, immutably,—as the alternation
of day and night, summer and winter,—others
contingently, as the motion of a body from its place,
if pushed, or the burning of a stick if thrust into the
fire. The knowledge that the former class of events
<em>has</em> gone on, uninterruptedly, for ages beyond all
memory, impresses us with a strong expectation that
it will continue to do so in the same manner; and
thus our notion of an <em>order of nature</em> is originated
and confirmed. If every thing were equally regular
and periodical, and the succession of events liable to
no change depending on our own will, it may be
doubted whether we should ever think of looking for
causes. No one regards the night as the cause of the
day, or the day of night. They are alternate effects
of a common cause, which their regular succession
alone gives us no sufficient clue for determining. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
is chiefly, perhaps entirely, from the other or contingent
class of events that we gain our notions of
cause and effect. From them alone we gather that
there are such things as laws of nature. The very
idea of a law includes that of contingency. “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Si
quis mala carmina condidisset, fuste ferito</i>;” if such
a case arise, such a course shall be followed,—if the
match be applied to the gunpowder, it will explode.
Every law is a provision for cases which <em>may</em> occur,
and has relation to an infinite number of cases that
never have occurred, and never will. Now, it is
this provision, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i>, for contingencies, this contemplation
of possible occurrences, and predisposal
of what shall happen, that impresses us with
the notion of a <em>law</em> and a <em>cause</em>. Among all the
possible combinations of the fifty or sixty elements
which chemistry shows to exist on the earth, it is
likely, nay almost certain, that <em>some</em> have never been
formed; that some elements, in some proportions,
and under some circumstances, have never yet been
placed in relation with one another. Yet no chemist
can doubt that it is <em>already fixed</em> what they will do
when the case does occur. They will obey certain
laws, of which we know nothing at present, but
which must <em>be</em> already fixed, or they could not be
laws. It is not by habit, or by trial and failure,
that they will learn what to do. When the contingency
occurs, there will be no hesitation, no consultation;—their
course will at once be decided, and
will always be the same if it occur ever so often in
succession, or in ever so many places at one and the
same instant. This is the perfection of a law, that
it includes all possible contingencies, and ensures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
implicit obedience,—and of this kind are the laws
of nature.</p>

<p>(27.) This use of the word <em>law</em>, however, our
readers will of course perceive has relation to us as
understanding, rather than to the materials of which
the universe consists as obeying, certain rules. To
obey a law, to act in <em>compliance</em> with a rule, supposes
an understanding and a will, a power of complying
or not, in the being who obeys and complies, which
we do not admit as belonging to mere matter. The
Divine Author of the universe cannot be supposed
to have laid down particular laws, enumerating all
individual contingencies, which his materials have
understood and obey,—this would be to attribute
to him the imperfections of human legislation;—but
rather, by creating them, endued with certain
fixed qualities and powers, he has impressed them
in their origin with the <em>spirit</em>, not the <em>letter</em>, of his
law, and made all their subsequent combinations and
relations inevitable consequences of this first impression,
by which, however, we would no way be
understood to deny the constant exercise of his
direct power in maintaining the system of nature, or
the ultimate emanation of every energy which material
agents exert from his immediate will, acting in
conformity with his own laws.</p>

<p>(28.) The discoveries of modern chemistry have
gone far to establish the truth of an opinion entertained
by some of the ancients, that the universe
consists of distinct, separate, indivisible <em>atoms</em>, or
individual beings so minute as to escape our senses,
except when united by millions, and by this aggregation
making up bodies of even the smallest visible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
bulk; and we have the strongest evidence that, although
there exist great and essential differences in
individuals among these atoms, they may yet all be
arranged in a very limited number of groups or
classes, all the individuals of each of which are, to
all intents and purposes, <em>exactly alike</em> in all their
properties. Now, when we see a great number of
things precisely alike, we do not believe this similarity
to have originated except from a common
principle independent of them; and that we recognise
this likeness, chiefly by the identity of their deportment
under similar circumstances, strengthens
rather than weakens the conclusion. A line of spinning-jennies<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>,
or a regiment of soldiers dressed
exactly alike, and going through precisely the same
evolutions, gives us no idea of independent existence:
we must see them act out of concert before
we can believe them to have independent wills and
properties, not impressed on them from without.
And this conclusion, which would be strong even
were there only two individuals precisely alike in
<em>all</em> respects and <em>for ever</em>, acquires irresistible force
when their number is multiplied beyond the power
of imagination to conceive. If we mistake not, then,
the discoveries alluded to effectually destroy the
idea of an <em>eternal self-existent matter</em>, by giving to
each of its atoms the essential characters, at once,
of a <em>manufactured article</em>, and a <em>subordinate agent</em>.</p>

<p>(29.) But to ascend to the origin of things, and
speculate on the creation, is not the business of the
natural philosopher. An humbler field is sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
for him in the endeavour to discover, as far as our
faculties will permit, what <em>are</em> these primary qualities
originally and unalterably impressed on matter, and
to discover the <em>spirit</em> of the laws of nature, which
includes groups and classes of relations and facts
from the <em>letter</em> which, as before observed, is presented
to us by single phenomena: or if, after all,
this should prove impossible; if such a step be
beyond our faculties; and the essential qualities of
material agents be really <em>occult</em>, or incapable of
being expressed in any form intelligible to our understandings,
at least to approach as near to their
comprehension as the nature of the case will allow;
and devise such forms of words as shall include and
<em>represent</em> the greatest possible multitude and variety
of phenomena.</p>

<p>(30.) Now, in this research there would seem one
great question to be disposed of before our enquiries
can even be commenced with any thing like a prospect
of success, which is, whether the laws of nature
themselves <em>have</em> that degree of permanence and
fixity which can render them subjects of systematic
discussion; or whether, on the other hand, the qualities
of natural agents are subject to mutation from
the lapse of time. To the ancients, who lived in
the infancy of the world, or rather, in the infancy
of man’s experience, this was a very rational subject
of question, and hence their distinctions between
corruptible and incorruptible matter. Thus, according
to some among them, the matter only of the
celestial spaces is pure, immutable, and incorruptible,
while all sublunary things are in a constant state
of lapse and change; the world becoming paralysed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and effete with age, and man himself deteriorating
in character, and diminishing at once in intellectual
and bodily stature. But to us, who have the experience
of some additional thousands of years, the
question of permanence is already, in a great measure,
decided in the affirmative. The refined speculations
of modern astronomy, grounding their conclusions
on observations made at very remote periods, have
proved to demonstration, that one at least of the
great powers of nature, the force of gravitation,
the main bond and support of the material universe,
has undergone no change in intensity from a high
antiquity. The stature of mankind is just what it
was three thousand years ago, as the specimens of
mummies which have been examined at various
times sufficiently show. The intellect of Newton,
Laplace, or Lagrange, may stand in fair competition
with that of Archimedes, Aristotle, or Plato; and
the virtues and patriotism of Washington with the
brightest examples of ancient history.</p>

<p>(31.) Again, the researches of chemists have
shown that what the vulgar call corruption, destruction,
&amp;c., is nothing but a change of arrangement of
the same ingredient elements, the disposition of the
same materials into other forms, without the loss
or actual destruction of a single atom; and thus any
doubts of the permanence of natural laws are discountenanced,
and the whole weight of <em>appearances</em>
thrown into the opposite scale. One of the most
obvious cases of apparent destruction is, when any
thing is ground to dust and scattered to the winds.
But it is one thing to grind a fabric to powder, and
another to annihilate its materials: scattered as they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
may be, they must fall somewhere, and continue,
if only as ingredients of the soil, to perform their
humble but useful part in the economy of nature.
The destruction produced by fire is more striking:
in many cases, as in the burning of a piece of
charcoal or a taper, there is no smoke, nothing
visibly dissipated and carried away; the burning
body wastes and disappears, while nothing <em>seems</em> to
be produced but warmth and light, which we are
not in the habit of considering as substances; and
when all has disappeared, except perhaps some
trifling ashes, we naturally enough suppose it is
gone, lost, destroyed. But when the question is
examined more exactly, we detect, in the invisible
stream of heated air which ascends from the glowing
coal or flaming wax, the <em>whole</em> ponderable matter,
only united in a new combination with the air,
and dissolved in it. Yet, so far from being thereby
destroyed, it is only become again what it was
before it existed in the form of charcoal or wax, an
active agent in the business of the world, and a
main support of vegetable and animal life, and is
still susceptible of running again and again the same
round, as circumstances may determine; so that,
for aught we can see to the contrary, the same
identical atom may lie concealed for thousands of
centuries in a limestone rock; may at length be
quarried, set free in the limekiln, mix with the air,
be absorbed from it by plants, and, in succession,
become a part of the frames of myriads of living
beings, till some concurrence of events consigns it
once more to a long repose, which, however, no way
unfits it from again resuming its former activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
(32.) Now, this absolute indestructibility of the
ultimate materials of the world, in periods commensurate
to our experience, and their obstinate retention
of the same properties, under whatever variety
of circumstances we choose to place them, however
violent and seemingly contradictory to their natures,
is, of itself, enough to render it highly improbable
that time alone should have any influence over
them. All that age or decay can do seems to be
included in a wasting of parts which are only dissipated,
not destroyed, or in a change of sensible properties,
which chemistry demonstrates to arise only
from new combinations of the same ingredients.
But, after all, the question is one entirely of experience:
we cannot be sure, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i>, that the laws
of nature are <em>immutable</em>; but we can ascertain, by
enquiry, <em>whether they change or not</em>; and to this
enquiry all experience answers in the negative. It
is not, of course, intended here to deny that great
operations, productive of extensive changes in the
visible state of nature,—such as, for instance, those
contemplated by the geologists, and embracing for
their completion vast periods of time,—are constantly
going on; but these are consequences and
fulfilments of the laws of nature, not contradictions
or exceptions to them. No theorist regards such
changes as alterations in the fundamental principles
of nature; he only endeavours to reconcile them,
and show how they result from laws already known,
and judges of the correctness of his theory by
their ultimate agreement.</p>

<p>(33.) But the laws of nature are not only permanent,
but consistent, intelligible, and discoverable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
with such a moderate degree of research, as is calculated
rather to stimulate than to weary curiosity.
If we were set down, as creatures of another world,
in any existing society of mankind, and began to
speculate on their actions, we should find it difficult
at first to ascertain whether they were subject to
any laws at all: but when, by degrees, we had
found out that they did consider themselves to be
so; and would then proceed to ascertain, from their
conduct and its consequences, what these laws were,
and in what spirit conceived; though we might not
perhaps have much difficulty in discovering single
rules applicable to particular cases, yet, the moment
we came to generalize, and endeavour from these to
ascend, step by step, and discover any steady pervading
principle, the mass of incongruities, absurdities,
and contradictions, we should encounter, would
either dishearten us from further enquiry or satisfy
us that what we were in search of did not exist.
It is quite the contrary in nature; there we find
no contradictions, no incongruities, but all is harmony.
What once is learnt we never have to
unlearn. As rules advance in generality, apparent
exceptions become regular; and equivoque, in her
sublime legislation, is as unheard of as maladministration.</p>

<p>(34.) Living, then, in a world where such laws
obtain, and under their immediate dominion, it is
manifestly of the utmost importance to know them,
were it for no other reason than to be sure, in all we
undertake, to have, at least, the law on our side,
so as not to struggle in vain against some insuperable
difficulty opposed to us by natural causes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
What pains and expense would not the alchemists,
for instance, have been spared by a knowledge of
those simple laws of composition and decomposition,
which now preclude all idea of the attainment of
their declared object! what an amount of ingenuity,
thrown away on the pursuit of the perpetual motion,
might have been turned to better use, if the simplest
laws of mechanics had been known and attended
to by the inventors of innumerable contrivances
destined to that end! What tortures, inflicted on
patients by imaginary cures of incurable diseases,
might have been dispensed with, had a few simple
principles of physiology been earlier recognised!</p>

<p>(35.) But if the laws of nature, on the one hand,
are invincible opponents, on the other, they are
irresistible auxiliaries; and it will not be amiss if
we regard them in each of those characters, and consider
the great importance of a knowledge of them
to <span class="locked">mankind,—</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p><span class="ii">I.</span> <i>In showing us how to avoid attempting impossibilities.</i></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
We shall therefore proceed to illustrate by examples
the effect of physical knowledge under each of these
<span class="locked">heads:—</span></p>

<p>(36.) Ex. 1. (35.) I. It is not many years since
an attempt was made to establish a colliery at
Bexhill, in Sussex. The appearance of thin seams
and sheets of fossil-wood and wood-coal, with some
other indications similar to what occur in the neighbourhood
of the great coal-beds in the north of
England, having led to the sinking of a shaft, and
the erection of machinery on a scale of vast expense,
not less than eighty thousand pounds are said to
have been laid out on this project, which, it is almost
needless to add, proved completely abortive, as every
geologist would have at once declared it must, the
whole assemblage of geological facts being adverse
to the existence of a regular coal-bed <em>in</em> the
Hastings’ <em>sand</em>; while this, on which Bexhill is
situated, is separated from the <em>coal-strata</em> by a
series of interposed beds of such enormous thickness
as to render all idea of penetrating <em>through</em>
them absurd. The history of mining operations is
full of similar cases, where a very moderate acquaintance
with the <em>usual order of nature</em>, to say
nothing of theoretical views, would have saved
many a sanguine adventurer from utter ruin.</p>

<p>(37.) Ex. 2. (35.) II. The smelting of iron requires
the application of the most violent heat that
can be raised, and is commonly performed in tall furnaces,
urged by great iron bellows driven by steam-engines.
Instead of employing this power to force
<em>air</em> into the furnace through the intervention of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
bellows, it was, on one occasion, attempted to employ
the steam itself in, apparently, a much less
circuitous manner; viz. by directing the current of
steam in a violent blast, from the boiler at once into
the fire. From one of the known ingredients of steam
being a highly inflammable body, and the other that
essential part of the air which supports combustion,
it was imagined that this would have the effect of
increasing the fire to tenfold fury, whereas it simply
<em>blew it out</em>; a result which a slight consideration
of the laws of chemical combination, and the
state in which the ingredient elements exist in
steam, would have enabled any one to predict
without a trial.</p>

<p>(38.) Ex. 3. (35.) II. After the invention of
the diving-bell, and its success in subaqueous processes,
it was considered highly desirable to devise
some means of remaining for any length of time
under water, and rising at pleasure without assistance,
so as either to examine, at leisure, the bottom,
or perform, at ease, any work that might be required.
Some years ago, an ingenious individual proposed a
project by which this end was to be accomplished.
It consisted in sinking the hull of a ship made quite
water-tight, with the decks and sides strongly supported
by shores, and the only entry secured by a
stout trap-door, in such a manner, that by disengaging,
from within, the weights employed to sink it,
it might rise of itself to the surface. To render the
trial more satisfactory, and the result more striking,
the projector himself made the first essay. It was
agreed that he should sink in twenty fathoms water,
and rise again without assistance at the expiration of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
twenty-four hours. Accordingly, making all secure,
fastening down his trap-door, and provided with all
necessaries, as well as with the means of making
signals to indicate his situation, this unhappy victim
of his own ingenuity entered and was sunk. No
signal was made, and the time appointed elapsed.
An immense concourse of people had assembled to
witness his rising, but in vain; for the vessel was
never seen more. The pressure of the water at so
great a depth had, no doubt, been completely under-estimated,
and the sides of the vessel being at once
crushed in, the unfortunate projector perished before
he could even make the signal concerted to indicate
his distress.</p>

<p>(39.) Ex. 4. (35.) III. In the granite quarries
near Seringapatam the most enormous blocks are
separated from the solid rock by the following neat
and simple process. The workman having found a
portion of the rock sufficiently extensive, and situated
near the edge of the part already quarried, lays
bare the upper surface, and marks on it a line in the
direction of the intended separation, along which a
groove is cut with a chisel about a couple of inches
in depth. Above this groove a narrow line of fire
is then kindled, and maintained till the rock below is
thoroughly heated, immediately on which a line of
men and women, each provided with a pot full of
cold water, suddenly sweep off the ashes, and pour
the water into the heated groove, when the rock at
once splits with a clean fracture. Square blocks of
six feet in the side, and upwards of eighty feet in
length, are sometimes detached by this method, or
by another equally simple and efficacious, but not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
easily explained without entering into particulars of
mineralogical detail.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>(40.) Ex. 5. (35.) III. Hardly less simple and
efficacious is the process used in some parts of France,
where mill-stones are made. When a mass of stone
sufficiently large is found, it is cut into a cylinder
several feet high, and the question then arises how
to subdivide this into horizontal pieces so as to make
as many mill-stones. For this purpose horizontal
indentations or grooves are chiselled out quite round
the cylinder, at distances corresponding to the thickness
intended to be given to the mill-stones, into
which wedges of dried wood are driven. These are
then wetted, or exposed to the night dew, and next
morning the different pieces are found separated
from each other by the expansion of the wood, consequent
on its absorption of moisture; an irresistible
natural power thus accomplishing, almost without
any trouble, and at no expense, an operation which,
from the peculiar hardness and texture of the stone,
would otherwise be impracticable but by the most
powerful machinery or the most persevering labour.</p>

<p>(41.) Ex. 6. (35.) III. To accomplish our ends
quickly is often of, at least, as much importance as
to accomplish them with little labour and expense.
There are innumerable processes which, if left to
themselves, <i>i. e.</i> to the ordinary operation of natural
causes, are done, and well done, but with extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
slowness, and in such cases it is often of the highest
practical importance to accelerate them. The
bleaching of linen, for instance, performed in the
natural way by exposure to sun, rain, and wind,
requires many weeks or even months for its completion;
whereas, by the simple immersion of the
cloth in a liquid, chemically prepared, the same
effect is produced in a few hours. The whole circle
of the arts, indeed, is nothing but one continued
comment upon this head of our subject. The
instances above given are selected, not on account
of their superior importance, but for the simplicity
and <em>directness</em> of application of the principles on
which they depend, to the objects intended to be
attained.</p>

<p>(42.) But so constituted is the mind of man, that
his views enlarge, and his desires and wants increase,
in the full proportion of the facilities afforded
to their gratification, and, indeed, with augmented
rapidity, so that no sooner has the successful exercise
of his powers accomplished any considerable
simplification or improvement of processes subservient
to his use or comfort, than his faculties are
again on the stretch to extend the limits of his
newly acquired power; and having once experienced
the advantages which are to be gathered by availing
himself of some of the powers of nature to accomplish
his ends, he is led thenceforward to regard
them all as a treasure placed at his disposal, if he
have only the art, the industry, or the good fortune,
to penetrate those recesses which conceal them from
immediate view. Having once learned to look on
knowledge as power, and to avail himself of it as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
such, he is no longer content to limit his enterprises
to the beaten track of former usage, but is constantly
led onwards to contemplate objects which, in a previous
stage of his progress, he would have regarded
as unattainable and visionary, had he even thought
of them at all. It is here that the investigation of
the hidden powers of nature becomes a mine, every
vein of which is pregnant with inexhaustible wealth,
and whose ramifications appear to extend in all directions
wherever human wants or curiosity may lead
us to explore.</p>

<p>(43.) Between the physical sciences and the arts of
life there subsists a constant mutual interchange of
good offices, and no considerable progress can be
made in the one without of necessity giving rise to
corresponding steps in the other. On the one hand,
every art is in some measure, and many entirely,
dependent on those very powers and qualities of the
material world which it is the object of physical
enquiry to investigate and explain; and, accordingly,
abundant examples might be cited of cases where
the remarks of experienced artists, or even ordinary
workmen, have led to the discovery of natural qualities,
elements, or combinations which have proved
of the highest importance in physics. Thus (to give
an instance), a soap-manufacturer remarks that the
residuum of his ley, when exhausted of the alkali for
which he employs it, produces a corrosion of his
copper boiler for which he cannot account. He
puts it into the hands of a scientific chemist for
analysis, and the result is the discovery of one of the
most singular and important chemical elements,
iodine. The properties of this, being studied, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
found to occur most appositely in illustration and
support of a variety of new, curious, and instructive
views then gaining ground in chemistry, and thus
exercise a marked influence over the whole body of
that science. Curiosity is excited: the origin of the
new substance is traced to the sea-plants from whose
ashes the principal ingredient of soap is obtained,
and ultimately to the sea-water itself. It is thence
hunted through nature, discovered in salt mines and
springs, and pursued into all bodies which have a
marine origin; among the rest, into sponge. A
medical practitioner<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> then calls to mind a reputed
remedy for the cure of one of the most grievous and
unsightly disorders to which the human species is
subject—the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">goître</i>—which infests the inhabitants
of mountainous districts to an extent that in this
favoured land we have happily no experience of,
and which was said to have been originally cured by
the ashes of burnt sponge. Led by this indication
he tries the effect of iodine on that complaint, and
the result establishes the extraordinary fact that
this singular substance, taken as a medicine, acts
with the utmost promptitude and energy on <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">goître</i>,
dissipating the largest and most inveterate in a short
time, and acting (of course, like all medicines, even
the most approved, with occasional failures,) as a
specific, or natural antagonist, against that odious
deformity. It is thus that any accession to our knowledge
of nature is sure, sooner or later, to make itself
felt in some practical application, and that a benefit
conferred on science by the casual observation or
shrewd remark of even an unscientific or illiterate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
person infallibly repays itself with interest, though
often in a way that could never have been at first
contemplated.</p>

<p>(44.) It is to such observation, reflected upon, however,
and matured into a rational and scientific form
by a mind deeply imbued with the best principles of
sound philosophy, that we owe the practice of vaccination;
a practice which has effectually subdued, in
every country where it has been introduced, one of
the most frightful scourges of the human race, and
in some extirpated it altogether. Happily for us
we know only by tradition the ravages of the small-pox,
as it existed among us hardly more than a century
ago, and as it would in a few years infallibly
exist again, were the barriers which this practice,
and that of inoculation, oppose to its progress
abandoned. Hardly inferior to this terrible scourge
on land was, within the last seventy or eighty years,
the scurvy at sea. The sufferings and destruction
produced by this horrid disorder on board our ships
when, as a matter of course, it broke out after a few
months’ voyage, seem now almost incredible. Deaths
to the amount of eight or ten a day in a moderate
ship’s company; bodies sewn up in hammocks and
washing about the decks for want of strength and
spirits on the part of the miserable survivors to cast
them overboard; and every form of loathsome and
excruciating misery of which the human frame is
susceptible:—such are the pictures which the narratives
of nautical adventure in those days continually
offer.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> At present the scurvy is almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
completely eradicated in the navy, partly, no doubt,
from increased and increasing attention to general
cleanliness, comfort, and diet; but mainly from the
constant use of a simple and palatable preventive,
the acid of the lemon, served out in daily rations.
If the gratitude of mankind be allowed on all hands
to be the just meed of the philosophic physician, to
whose discernment in seizing, and perseverance in
forcing it on public notice we owe the great safeguard
of infant life, it ought not to be denied to
those<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> whose skill and discrimination have thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
strengthened the sinews of our most powerful arm,
and obliterated one of the darkest features in the
most glorious of all professions.</p>

<p>(45.) These last, however, are instances of simple
observation, limited to the point immediately in view,
and assuming only so far the character of science as
a systematic adoption of good and rejection of evil,
when grounded on experience carefully weighed,
justly entitle it to do. They are not on that account
less appositely cited as instances of the importance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
of a knowledge of nature and its laws to our well-being;
though, like the great inventions of the mariner’s
compass and of gunpowder, they may have
stood, in their origin, unconnected with more general
views. They are rather to be looked upon as
the spontaneous produce of a territory essentially
fertile, than as forming part of the succession of
harvests which the same bountiful soil, diligently
cultivated, is capable of yielding. The history of
iodine above related affords, however, a perfect
specimen of the manner in which a knowledge of
natural properties and laws, collected from facts
having no reference to the object to which they
have been subsequently applied, enables us to set in
array the resources of nature against herself; and
deliberately, of afore-thought, to devise remedies
against the dangers and inconveniences which beset
us. In this view we might instance, too, the <em>conductor</em>,
which, in countries where thunder-storms
are more frequent and violent than in our own,
and at sea (where they are attended with peculiar
danger, both from the greater probability of accident,
and its more terrible consequences when it
does occur,) forms a most real and efficient preservative
against the effects of lightning<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>:—the <em>safety-lamp</em>,
which enables us to walk with light and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
security while surrounded with an atmosphere more
explosive than gunpowder:—the <em>life-boat</em>, which
cannot be sunk, and which offers relief in circumstances
of all others the most distressing to humanity,
and of which a recent invention promises to
extend the principle to ships of the largest class:—the
<em>lighthouse</em>, with the capital improvements which
the lenses of Brewster and Fresnel, and the elegant
lamp of lieutenant Drummond, have conferred, and
promise yet to confer by their wonderful powers,
the one of producing the most intense light yet
known, the others of conveying it undispersed to
great distances:—the discovery of the disinfectant
powers of chlorine, and its application to the destruction
of miasma and contagion:—that of <em>quinine</em>,
the essential principle in which reside the febrifuge
qualities of the Peruvian bark, a discovery by which
posterity is yet to benefit in its full extent, but
which has already begun to diffuse <em>comparative</em> comfort
and health through regions almost desolated by
pestiferous exhalations<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>;—and, if we desist, it is
not because the list is exhausted, but because a
sample, not a catalogue, is intended.</p>

<p>(46.) One instance more, however, we will add, to
illustrate the manner in which a most familiar effect,
which seemed destined only to amuse children, or,
at best, to furnish a philosophic toy, may become a
safeguard of human life, and a remedy for a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
serious and distressing evil. In needle manufactories
the workmen who point the needles are
constantly exposed to excessively minute particles
of steel which fly from the grindstones, and mix,
though imperceptible to the eye, as the finest dust
in the air, and are inhaled with their breath. The
effect, though imperceptible on a short exposure,
yet, being constantly repeated from day to day,
produces a constitutional irritation dependent on
the tonic properties of the steel, which is sure to
terminate in pulmonary consumption; insomuch,
that persons employed in this kind of work used
scarcely ever to attain the age of forty years.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> In
vain was it attempted to purify the air before its
entry into the lungs by gauzes or linen guards; the
dust was too fine and penetrating to be obstructed
by such coarse expedients, till some ingenious person
bethought him of that wonderful power which
every child who searches for its mother’s needle
with a magnet, or admires the motions and arrangement
of a few steel filings on a sheet of paper held
above it, sees in exercise. Masks of magnetized
steel wire are now constructed and adapted to the
faces of the workmen. By these the air is not
merely <em>strained</em> but <em>searched</em> in its passage through
them, and each obnoxious atom arrested and removed.</p>

<p>(47.) Perhaps there is no result which places in
a stronger light the advantages which are to be
derived from a mere knowledge of the <em>usual order
of nature</em>, without any attempt on our part to modify
it, and apart from all consideration of its causes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
than the institution of life-assurances. Nothing is
more uncertain than the life of a single individual;
and it is the sense of this insecurity which has given
rise to such institutions. They are, in their nature
and objects, the precise reverse of gambling speculations,
their object being to equalize vicissitude,
and to place the pecuniary relations of numerous
masses of mankind, in so far as they extend, on a
footing independent of individual casualty. To do
this with the greatest possible advantage, or indeed
with any advantage at all, it is necessary to know the
<em>laws of mortality</em>, or the average numbers of individuals,
out of a great multitude, who die at every
period of life from infancy to extreme old age. At
first sight this would seem a hopeless enquiry; to
some, perhaps, a presumptuous one. But it has been
made; and the result is, that, abating extraordinary
causes, such as wars, pestilence, and the like, a remarkable
regularity <em>does</em> obtain, quite sufficient
to afford grounds not only for general estimations,
but for nice calculations of risk and adventure, such
as infallibly to insure the success of any such institution
founded on good computations; and thus to
confer such stability on the fortunes of families dependent
on the exertions of one individual as to constitute
an important feature in modern civilization.
The only thing to be feared in such institutions is
their too great multiplication and consequent competition,
by which a spirit of gambling and underbidding
is liable to be generated among their conductors,
and the very mischief may be produced,
on a scale of frightful extent, which they are
especially intended to prevent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
(48.) We have hitherto considered only cases in
which a knowledge of natural laws enables us to improve
our condition, by counteracting evils of which,
but for its possession, we must have remained forever
the helpless victims. Let us now take a similar view
of those in which we are enabled to call in nature
as an auxiliary to augment our actual power, and
capacitate us for undertakings, which without such
aid might seem to be hopeless. Now, to this end, it
is necessary that we should form a just conception
of what those hidden powers of nature <em>are</em>, which
we can at pleasure call into action;—how far they
transcend the measure of human force, and set at
naught the efforts not only of individuals but of
whole nations of men.</p>

<p>(49.) It is well known to modern engineers, that
<em>there is virtue</em> in a bushel of coals properly consumed,
to raise seventy millions of pounds weight a
foot high. This is actually the <em>average</em> effect of an
engine at this moment working in Cornwall.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Let
us pause a moment, and consider what this is
equivalent to in matters of practice.</p>

<p>(50.) The ascent of Mont Blanc from the valley of
Chamouni is considered, and with justice, as the
most toilsome feat that a strong man can execute in
two days. The combustion of two pounds of coal
would place him on the summit.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
(51.) The Menai Bridge, one of the most stupendous
works of art that has been raised by man in
modern ages, consists of a mass of iron, not less than
four millions of pounds in weight, suspended at a
medium height of about 120 feet above the sea.
The consumption of seven bushels of coal would
suffice to raise it to the place where it hangs.</p>

<p>(52.) The great pyramid of Egypt is composed of
granite. It is 700 feet in the side of its base, and 500
in perpendicular height, and stands on eleven acres
of ground. Its weight is, therefore, 12,760 millions
of pounds, at a medium height of 125 feet; consequently
it would be raised by the effort of about
630 chaldrons of coal, a quantity consumed in some
founderies in a week.</p>

<p>(53.) The annual consumption of coal in London
is estimated at 1,500,000 chaldrons. The effort of
this quantity would suffice to raise a cubical block of
marble, 2200 feet in the side, through a space equal
to its own height, or to pile one such mountain upon
another. The Monte Nuovo, near Pozzuoli, (which
was erupted in a single night by volcanic fire,)
might have been raised by such an effort, from a
depth of 40,000 feet, or about eight miles.</p>

<p>(54.) It will be observed, that, in the above statement,
the inherent power of fuel is, of necessity,
greatly under-rated. It is not pretended by engineers
that the economy of fuel is yet pushed to its utmost
limit, or that the whole effective power is obtained
in any application of fire yet devised; so that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
we to say 100 millions instead of 70, we should probably
be nearer the truth.</p>

<p>(55.) The powers of wind and water, which we are
constantly impressing into our service, can scarcely
be called latent or hidden, yet it is not fully considered,
in general, what they <em>do</em> effect for us.
Those who would judge of what advantage may be
taken of the wind, for example, even on land (not
to speak of navigation), may turn their eyes on Holland.
A great portion of the most valuable and
populous tract of this country lies much below the
level of the sea, and is only preserved from inundation
by the maintenance of embankments.
Though these suffice to keep out the abrupt influx
of the ocean, they cannot oppose that law
of nature, by which fluids, in seeking their level,
insinuate themselves through the pores and subterraneous
channels of a loose sandy soil, and keep
the country in a constant state of infiltration
from below upwards. To counteract this tendency,
as well as to get rid of the rain water, which has no
natural outlet, pumps worked by windmills are established
in great numbers, on the dams and embankments,
which pour out the water, as from a leaky ship,
and in effect preserve the country from submersion,
by taking advantage of every wind that blows. To
drain the Haarlem lake<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> would seem a hopeless
project to any speculators but those who had the
steam-engine at their command, or had learnt in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Holland what might be accomplished by the constant
agency of the desultory but unwearied powers
of wind. But the Dutch engineer measures his
surface, calculates the number of his pumps, and,
trusting to time and his experience of the operation
of the winds for the success of his undertaking,
boldly forms his plans to lay dry the bed of an inland
sea, of which those who stand on one shore
cannot see the other.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>(56.) To gunpowder, as a source of mechanical
power, it seems hardly necessary to call attention;
yet it is only when we endeavour to <em>confine</em> it, that
we get a full conception of the immense energy of
that astonishing agent. In count Rumford’s experiments,
twenty-eight grains of powder confined in
a cylindrical space, <em>which it just filled</em>, tore asunder
a piece of iron which would have resisted a strain of
400,000 lbs.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>, applied at no greater mechanical disadvantage.</p>

<p>(57.) But chemistry furnishes us with means of
calling into sudden action forces of a character infinitely
more tremendous than that of gunpowder.
The terrific violence of the different fulminating
compositions is such, that they can only be compared
to those untameable animals, whose ferocious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
strength has hitherto defied all useful management,
or rather to spirits evoked by the spells of a
magician, manifesting a destructive and unapproachable
power, which makes him but too happy to close
his book, and break his wand, as the price of escaping:
unhurt from the storm he has raised. Such
powers are not yet subdued to our purposes, whatever
they may hereafter be; but, in the expansive
force of gases, liberated slowly and manageably from
chemical mixtures, we have a host of inferior, yet
still most powerful, energies, capable of being employed
in a variety of useful ways, according to
emergencies.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>(58.) Such are the forces which nature lends us for
the accomplishment of our purposes, and which it is
the province of practical Mechanics to teach us to
combine and apply in the most advantageous manner;
without which the mere command of power
would amount to nothing. Practical Mechanics is,
in the most pre-eminent sense, a <em>scientific art</em>; and
it may be truly asserted, that almost all the great
combinations of modern mechanism, and many of its
refinements and nicer improvements, are creations of
pure intellect, grounding its exertion upon a moderate
number of very elementary propositions in
theoretical mechanics and geometry. On this head
we might dwell long, and find ample matter, both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
for reflection and wonder; but it would require
not volumes merely, but libraries, to enumerate
and describe the prodigies of ingenuity which have
been lavished on every thing connected with machinery
and engineering. By these it is that we are
enabled to diffuse over the whole earth the productions
of any part of it; to fill every corner of
it with miracles of art and labour, in exchange for its
peculiar commodities; and to concentrate around
us, in our dwellings, apparel and utensils, the skill and
workmanship not of a few expert individuals, but
of all who, in the present and past generations, have
contributed their improvements to the processes of
our manufactures.</p>

<p>(59.) The transformations of chemistry, by which
we are enabled to convert the most apparently useless
materials into important objects in the arts, are
opening up to us every day sources of wealth and
convenience of which former ages had no idea, and
which have been pure gifts of science to man.
Every department of art has felt their influence, and
new instances are continually starting forth of the
unlimited resources which this wonderful science
developes in the most sterile parts of nature. Not
to mention the impulse which its progress has given
to a host of other sciences, which will come more
particularly under consideration in another part of
this discourse, what strange and unexpected results
has it not brought to light in its application to some
of the most common objects! Who, for instance,
would have conceived that linen rags were capable
of producing <em>more than their own weight</em> of sugar, by
the simple agency of one of the cheapest and most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
abundant acids?<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>—that dry bones could be a magazine
of nutriment, capable of preservation for years,
and ready to yield up their sustenance in the form
best adapted to the support of life, on the application
of that powerful agent, steam, which enters so largely
into all our processes, or of an acid at once cheap
and durable?<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>—that sawdust itself is susceptible
of conversion into a substance bearing no remote
analogy to bread; and though certainly less palatable
than that of flour, yet no way disagreeable,
and both wholesome and digestible as well as highly
nutritive?<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> What economy, in all processes where
chemical agents are employed, is introduced by the
exact knowledge of the proportions in which natural
elements unite, and their mutual powers of displacing
each other! What perfection in all the arts
where fire is employed, either in its more violent
applications, (as, for instance, in the smelting of
metals by the introduction of well adapted fluxes,
whereby we obtain the whole produce of the ore in
its purest state,) or in its milder forms, as in sugar-refining
(the whole modern practice of which depends
on a curious and delicate remark of a late
eminent scientific chemist on the nice adjustment of
temperature at which the crystallization of syrup
takes place); and a thousand other arts which it
would be tedious to enumerate!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
(60.) Armed with such powers and resources,
it is no wonder if the enterprise of man should
lead him to form and execute projects which, to
one uninformed of their grounds, would seem altogether
disproportionate. Were they to have been
proposed at once, we should, no doubt, have rejected
them as such: but developed, as they have
been, in the slow succession of ages, they have
only taught us that things regarded impossible in
one generation may become easy in the next; and
that the power of man over nature is limited only
by the one condition, that it must be exercised in
conformity with the laws of nature. He must study
those laws as he would the disposition of a horse he
would ride, or the character of a nation he would
govern; and the moment he presumes either to
thwart her fundamental rules, or ventures to measure
his strength with hers, he is at once rendered
severely sensible of his imbecility, and meets the
deserved punishment of his rashness and folly.
But if, on the other hand, he will consent to use,
without abusing, the resources thus abundantly
placed at his disposal, and obey that he may command,
there seems scarcely any conceivable limit to
the degree in which the <em>average</em> physical condition
of great masses of mankind may be improved, their
wants supplied, and their conveniences and comforts
increased. Without adopting such an exaggerated
view, as to assert that the meanest inhabitant of a
civilized society is superior in physical condition to
the lordly savage, whose energy and uncultivated
ability gives him a natural predominance over his
fellow denizens of the forest,—at least, if we compare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
like with like, and consider the multitude of human
beings who are enabled, in an advanced state of
society, to subsist in a degree of comfort and abundance,
which at best only a few of the most fortunate
in a less civilized state could command, we shall not
be at a loss to perceive the principle on which we
ought to rest our estimate of the advantages of civilization;
and which applies with hardly less force to
every degree of it, when contrasted with that next
inferior, than to the broad distinction between civilized
and barbarous life in general.</p>

<p>(61.) The difference of the degrees in which the individuals
of a great community enjoy the good things
of life has been a theme of declamation and discontent
in all ages; and it is doubtless our paramount
duty, in every state of society, to alleviate the pressure
of the purely evil part of this distribution as much
as possible, and, by all the means we can devise, secure
the lower links in the chain of society from
dragging in dishonour and wretchedness: but there
is a point of view in which the picture is at least
materially altered in its expression. In comparing
society on its present immense scale, with its
infant or less developed state, we must at least
take care to enlarge every feature in the same
proportion. If, on comparing the <em>very</em> lowest states
in civilized and savage life, we admit a difficulty in
deciding to which the preference is due, at least
in every superior grade we cannot hesitate a moment;
and if we institute a similar comparison in
every different stage of its progress, we cannot fail
to be struck with the rapid <em>rate of dilatation</em> which
every degree upward of the scale, so to speak, exhibits,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
and which, in an estimate of averages, gives
an immense preponderance to the present over
every former condition of mankind, and, for aught
we can see to the contrary, will place succeeding
generations in the same degree of superior relation
to the present that this holds to those passed away.
Or we may put the same proposition in other words,
and, admitting the existence of every inferior grade
of advantage in a higher state of civilization which
subsisted in the preceding, we shall find, first, that,
taking state for state, the proportional numbers of
those who enjoy the higher degrees of advantage
increases with a constantly accelerated rapidity as
society advances; and, secondly, that the superior
extremity of the scale is constantly enlarging by
the addition of new degrees. The condition of a
European prince is now as far superior, in the command
of real comforts and conveniences, to that of
one in the middle ages, as that to the condition of
one of his own dependants.</p>

<p>(62.) The advantages conferred by the augmentation
of our physical resources through the medium
of increased knowledge and improved art have this
peculiar and remarkable property,—that they are
in their nature diffusive, and cannot be enjoyed in
any exclusive manner by a few. An eastern despot
may extort the riches and monopolize the art of
his subjects for his own personal use; he may
spread around him an unnatural splendour and
luxury, and stand in strange and preposterous contrast
with the general penury and discomfort of
his people; he may glitter in jewels of gold and
raiment of needlework; but the wonders of well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
contrived and executed manufacture which we use
daily, and the comforts which have been invented,
tried, and improved upon by thousands, in every
form of domestic convenience, and for every ordinary
purpose of life, can never be enjoyed by him.
To produce a state of things in which the physical
advantages of civilized life can exist in a high degree,
the stimulus of increasing comforts and constantly
elevated desires, must have been felt by
millions; since it is not in the power of a few
individuals to create that wide demand for useful
and ingenious applications, which alone can lead to
great and rapid improvements, unless backed by
that arising from the speedy diffusion of the same
advantages among the mass of mankind.</p>

<p>(63.) If this be true of physical advantages, it
applies with still greater force to intellectual. Knowledge
can neither be adequately cultivated nor
adequately enjoyed by a few; and although the
conditions of our existence on earth may be such as
to preclude an abundant supply of the physical necessities
of all who may be born, there is no such
law of nature in force against that of our intellectual
and moral wants. Knowledge is not, like food, destroyed
by use, but rather augmented and perfected.
It acquires not, perhaps, a greater certainty,
but at least a confirmed authority and a probable
duration, by universal assent; and there is no body
of knowledge so complete, but that it may acquire
accession, or so free from error but that it may
receive correction in passing through the minds of
millions. Those who admire and love knowledge for
its own sake ought to wish to see its elements made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
accessible to all, were it only that they may be the
more thoroughly examined into, and more effectually
developed in their consequences, and receive that
ductility and plastic quality which the pressure of
minds of all descriptions, constantly moulding them
to their purposes, can alone bestow. But to this
end it is necessary that it should be divested, as far
as possible, of artificial difficulties, and stripped of
all such technicalities as tend to place it in the light
of a craft and a mystery, inaccessible without a
kind of apprenticeship. Science, of course, like
every thing else, has its own peculiar terms, and,
so to speak, its idioms of language; and these it
would be unwise, were it even possible, to relinquish:
but every thing that tends to clothe it in a strange
and repulsive garb, and especially every thing that,
to keep up an appearance of superiority in its professors
over the rest of mankind, assumes an unnecessary
guise of profundity and obscurity, should be sacrificed
without mercy. Not to do this, is to deliberately
reject the light which the natural unencumbered
good sense of mankind is capable of throwing on
every subject, even in the elucidation of principles:
but where principles are to be applied to practical
uses it becomes absolutely necessary; as all mankind
have then an interest in their being so familiarly
understood, that no mistakes shall arise in
their application.</p>

<p>(64.) The same remark applies to arts. They cannot
be perfected till their whole processes are laid open,
and their language simplified and rendered universally
intelligible. Art is the application of knowledge
to a practical end. If the knowledge be merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
accumulated experience, the art is <em>empirical</em>; but
if it be experience reasoned upon and brought under
general principles, it assumes a higher character,
and becomes a <em>scientific art</em>. In the progress of
mankind from barbarism to civilised life, the arts
necessarily precede science. The wants and cravings
of our animal constitution must be satisfied;
the comforts, and some of the luxuries, of life must
exist. Something must be given to the vanity of
show, and more to the pride of power: the round
of baser pleasures must have been tried and found
insufficient, before intellectual ones can gain a footing;
and when they have obtained it, the delights
of poetry and its sister arts still take precedence of
contemplative enjoyments, and the severer pursuits
of thought; and when these in time begin to charm
from their novelty, and sciences begin to arise, they
will at first be those of pure speculation. The mind
delights to escape from the trammels which had
bound it to earth, and luxuriates in its newly found
powers. Hence, the abstractions of geometry—the
properties of numbers—the movements of the
celestial spheres—whatever is abstruse, remote, and
extramundane—become the first objects of infant
science. Applications come late: the arts continue
slowly progressive, but their realm remains separated
from that of science by a wide gulf which can only
be passed by a powerful spring. They form their own
language and their own conventions, which none but
artists can understand. The whole tendency of
empirical art, is to bury itself in technicalities, and
to place its pride in particular short cuts and mysteries
known only to adepts; to surprise and astonish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
by results, but conceal processes. The character
of science is the direct contrary. It delights to
lay itself open to enquiry, and is not satisfied
with its conclusions, till it can make the road to
them broad and beaten: and in its applications it
preserves the same character; its whole aim being
to strip away all technical mystery, to illuminate
every dark recess, and to gain free access to all
processes, with a view to improve them on rational
principles. It would seem that a union of two qualities
almost opposite to each other—a going forth of
the thoughts in two directions, and a sudden transfer
of ideas from a remote station in one to an equally
distant one in the other—is required to start the first
idea of <em>applying science</em>. Among the Greeks, this
point was attained by Archimedes, but attained too
late, on the eve of that great eclipse of science
which was destined to continue for nearly eighteen
centuries, till Galileo in Italy, and Bacon in England,
at once dispelled the darkness: the one, by
his inventions and discoveries; the other, by the
irresistible force of his arguments and eloquence.</p>

<p>(65.) Finally, the improvement effected in the condition
of mankind by advances in physical science
as applied to the useful purposes of life, is very far
from being limited to their direct consequences in
the more abundant supply of our physical wants, and
the increase of our comforts. Great as these benefits
are, they are yet but steps to others of a still higher
kind. The successful results of our experiments
and reasonings in natural philosophy, and the incalculable
advantages which experience, systematically
consulted and dispassionately reasoned on, has conferred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
in matters purely physical, tend of necessity
to impress something of the well weighed and progressive
character of science on the more complicated
conduct of our social and moral relations. It
is thus that legislation and politics become gradually
regarded as experimental sciences; and history, not,
as formerly, the mere record of tyrannies and slaughters,
which, by immortalizing the execrable actions
of one age, perpetuates the ambition of committing
them in every succeeding one, but as the archive
of experiments, successful and unsuccessful, gradually
accumulating towards the solution of the
grand problem—how the advantages of government
are to be secured with the least possible inconvenience
to the governed. The celebrated apophthegm,
that nations never profit by experience, becomes
yearly more and more untrue. Political economy,
at least, is found to have sound principles, founded
in the moral and physical nature of man, which,
however lost sight of in particular measures—however
even temporarily controverted and borne down
by clamour—have yet a stronger and stronger testimony
borne to them in each succeeding generation,
by which they must, sooner or later, prevail. The
idea once conceived and verified, that great and
noble ends are to be achieved, by which the condition
of the whole human species shall be permanently
bettered, by bringing into exercise a sufficient quantity
of sober thought, and by a proper adaptation of
means, is of itself sufficient to set us earnestly on
reflecting what ends <em>are</em> truly great and noble, either
in themselves, or as conducive to others of a still
loftier character; because we are not now, as heretofore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
hopeless of attaining them. It is not now
equally harmless and insignificant, whether we are
right or wrong; since we are no longer supinely and
helplessly carried down the stream of events, but
feel ourselves capable of buffetting at least with its
waves, and perhaps of riding triumphantly over
them: for why should we despair that the reason
which has enabled us to subdue all nature to our
purposes, should (if permitted and assisted by the
providence of God) achieve a far more difficult conquest;
and ultimately find some means of enabling
the collective wisdom of mankind to bear down
those obstacles which individual short-sightedness,
selfishness, and passion, oppose to all improvements,
and by which the highest hopes are continually
blighted, and the fairest prospects marred.</p>

<p class="in0">(66.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">I</span>nto</span> abstract science, as we have before observed,
the notion of cause does not enter. The
truths it is conversant with are <em>necessary</em> ones, and
exist independent of cause. There may be
no such real <em>thing</em> as a right-lined triangle
marked out in space; but the moment we conceive
one in our minds, we cannot refuse to admit the
sum of its three angles to be equal to two right
angles; and if in addition we conceive one of its
angles to be a right angle, we cannot thenceforth
refuse to admit that the sum of the squares on the
two sides, including the right angle, is equal to
the square on the side subtending it. To maintain
the contrary, would be, in effect, to deny its
being right angled. No one <em>causes</em> or <em>makes</em> all
the diameters of an ellipse to be bisected in its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
centre. To assert the contrary, would not be to
rebel against a power, but to deny our own words.
But in natural science <em>cause</em> and <em>effect</em> are the ultimate
relations we contemplate; and <em>laws</em>, whether
imposed or maintained, which, for aught we can perceive,
might have been other than they are. This
distinction is very important. A clever man, shut
up alone and allowed unlimited time, might reason
out for himself all the truths of mathematics, by
proceeding from those simple notions of space and
number of which he cannot divest himself without
ceasing to think. But he could never tell, by any
effort of reasoning, what would become of a lump
of sugar if immersed in water, or what impression
would be produced on his eye by mixing the colours
yellow and blue.</p>

<p>(67.) We have thus pointed out to us, as the great,
and indeed only ultimate source of our knowledge of
nature and its laws, <span class="smcap smaller">EXPERIENCE</span>; by which we
mean, not the experience of one man only, or of
one generation, but the accumulated experience of
all mankind in all ages, registered in books or recorded
by tradition. But experience may be acquired
in two ways: either, first, by noticing facts as
they occur, without any attempt to influence the
frequency of their occurrence, or to vary the circumstances
under which they occur; this is <span class="smcap smaller">OBSERVATION</span>:
or, secondly, by putting in action causes
and agents over which we have control, and purposely
varying their combinations, and noticing
what effects take place; this is <span class="smcap smaller">EXPERIMENT</span>. To
these two sources we must look as the fountains of
all natural science. It is not intended, however, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
thus distinguishing observation from experiment,
to place them in any kind of contrast. Essentially
they are much alike, and differ rather in degree
than in kind; so that, perhaps, the terms <em>passive</em>
and <em>active observation</em> might better express their
distinction; but it is, nevertheless, highly important
to mark the different states of mind in
inquiries carried on by their respective aids, as
well as their different effects in promoting the
progress of science. In the former, we sit still
and listen to a tale, told us, perhaps obscurely,
piecemeal, and at long intervals of time, with
our attention more or less awake. It is only by
after-rumination that we gather its full import;
and often, when the opportunity is gone by, we
have to regret that our attention was not more
particularly directed to some point which, at the
time, appeared of little moment, but of which we
at length appretiate the importance. In the latter,
on the other hand, we cross-examine our witness,
and by comparing one part of his evidence with
the other, while he is yet before us, and reasoning
upon it in his presence, are enabled to put pointed
and searching questions, the answer to which may
at once enable us to make up our minds. Accordingly
it has been found invariably, that in those
departments of physics where the phenomena are
beyond our control, or into which experimental
enquiry, from other causes, has not been carried,
the progress of knowledge has been slow, uncertain,
and irregular; while in such as admit of experiment,
and in which mankind have agreed to its
adoption, it has been rapid, sure, and steady. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
example, in our knowledge of the nature and causes
of volcanoes, earthquakes, the fall of stones from
the sky, the appearance of new stars and disappearance
of old ones, and other of those great
phenomena of nature which are altogether beyond
our command, and at the same time are of too rare
occurrence to permit any one to repeat and rectify
his impressions respecting them, we know little
more now than in the earliest times. Here our
tale is told us slowly, and in broken sentences. In
astronomy, again, we have at least an uninterrupted
narrative; the opportunity of observation is constantly
present, and makes up in some measure
for the impossibility of varying our point of view,
and calling for information at the precise moment
it is wanted. Accordingly, astronomy, regarded
as a science of mere observation, arrived, though
by very slow degrees, to a state of considerable
maturity. But the moment that it became a
branch of mechanics, a science essentially experimental,
(that is to say, one in which any
principle laid down can be subjected to immediate
and decisive <em>trial</em>, and where experience does
not require to be waited for,) its progress suddenly
acquired a tenfold acceleration; nay, to such a
degree, that it has been asserted, and we believe
with truth, that were the records of all observations
from the earliest ages annihilated, leaving
only those made in a single observatory<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>, during
a single lifetime<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>, the whole of this most perfect
of sciences might, from those data, and as to
the objects included in them, be at once reconstructed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and appear precisely as it stood at their
conclusion. To take another instance: mineralogy,
till modern times, could hardly be said to exist.
The description of even the precious stones in
Theophrastus and Pliny are, in most cases, hardly
sufficient to identify them, and in many fall short
even of that humble object; more recent observers,
by attending more carefully to the obvious characters
of minerals, had formed a pretty extensive
catalogue of them, and made various attempts to
arrange and methodize the knowledge thus acquired,
and even to deduce some general conclusions
respecting the forms they habitually assume:
but from the moment that chemical analysis was
applied to resolve them into their constituent elements,
and that, led by a happy accident, the
genius of Bergmann discovered the general fact, that
they could be <em>cloven</em> or split in such directions as
to lay bare their peculiar primitive or fundamental
forms, (which lay concealed within them, as the
statue might be conceived encrusted in its marble
envelope,)—from that moment, mineralogy ceased
to be an unmeaning list of names, a mere laborious
cataloguing of stones and rubbish, and became,
what it now is, a regular, methodical, and most
important science, in which every year is bringing
to light new relations, new laws, and new practical
applications.</p>

<p>(68.) Experience once recognized as the fountain
of all our knowledge of nature, it follows that, in the
study of nature and its laws, we ought at once to
make up our minds to dismiss as idle prejudices, or
at least suspend as premature, any preconceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
notion of what might or what ought to be the order
of nature in any proposed case, and content ourselves
with observing, as a plain matter of fact, what
<em>is</em>. To experience we refer, as the only ground of all
physical enquiry. But before experience itself can
be used with advantage, there is one preliminary
step to make, which depends wholly on ourselves:
it is the absolute dismissal and clearing the mind
of all prejudice, from whatever source arising, and
the determination to stand and fall by the result of
a direct appeal to facts in the first instance, and of
strict logical deduction from them afterwards. Now,
it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of
prejudices, which exercise very different dominion
over the mind, and, moreover, differ extremely in
the difficulty of dispossessing them, and the process
to be gone through for that purpose. These <span class="locked">are,—</span></p>

2. Prejudices of sense.
</p>

<p>(69.) By prejudices of opinion, we mean opinions
hastily taken up, either from the assertion of others,
from our own superficial views, or from vulgar observation,
and which, from being constantly admitted
without dispute, have obtained the strong
hold of habit on our minds. Such were the opinions
once maintained that the earth is the greatest body
in the universe, and placed immovable in its centre,
and all the rest of the universe created for its
sole use; that it is the nature of fire and of sounds
to ascend; that the moonlight is cold; that dews <em>fall</em>
from the air, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(70.) To combat and destroy such prejudices we
may proceed in two ways, either by demonstrating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
the falsehood of the facts alleged in their support,
or by showing how the appearances, which seem to
countenance them, are more satisfactorily accounted
for without their admission. But it is unfortunately
the nature of prejudices of opinion to adhere,
in a certain degree, to every mind, and to some
with pertinacious obstinacy, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pigris radicibus</i>, after all
ground for their reasonable entertainment is destroyed.
Against such a disposition the student of
natural science must contend with all his power. Not
that we are so unreasonable as to demand of him an
instant and peremptory dismission of all his former
opinions and judgments; all we require is, that he
will hold them without bigotry, retain till he shall
see reason to question them, and be ready to resign
them when fairly proved untenable, and to doubt
them when the weight of probability is shown to lie
against them. If he refuse this, he is incapable of
science.</p>

<p>(71.) Our resistance against the destruction of
the other class of prejudices, those of sense, is commonly
more violent at first, but less persistent, than
in the case of those of opinion. Not to trust the
evidence of our senses, seems, indeed, a hard condition,
and one which, if proposed, none would comply
with. But it is not the direct evidence of our
senses that we are in any case called upon to reject,
but only the erroneous judgments we unconsciously
form from them, and this only when they can be
shown to be so <em>by counter evidence of the same sort</em>;
when one sense is brought to testify against another,
for instance; or the same sense against itself, and
the obvious conclusions in the two cases disagree, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
as to compel us to acknowledge that one or other
must be wrong. For example, nothing at first can
seem a more rational, obvious, and incontrovertible
conclusion, than that the <em>colour</em> of an object is an
inherent quality, like its weight, hardness, &amp;c. and
that to <em>see</em> the object, and see it <em>of its own colour</em>,
when nothing intervenes between our eyes and it,
are one and the same thing. Yet this is only a
prejudice; and that it is so, is shown by bringing forward
the same sense of vision which led to its adoption,
as evidence on the other side; for, when the
differently coloured prismatic rays are thrown, in a
dark room, in succession upon any object, whatever
be the colour we are in the habit of calling its own,
it will appear of the particular hue of the light which
falls upon it: a yellow paper, for instance, will appear
scarlet when illuminated by red rays, yellow
when by yellow, green by green, and blue by blue
rays; its own (so called) proper colour <em>not in the least
degree mixing with that it so exhibits</em>.</p>

<p>(72.) To give one or two more examples of the
kind of illusion which the senses practise on us, or
rather which we practise on ourselves, by a misinterpretation
of their evidence: the moon at its
rising and setting appears much larger than when
high up in the sky. This is, however, a mere erroneous
judgment; for when we come to measure its
diameter, so far from finding our conclusion borne
out by fact, we actually find it to measure materially
less. Here is eyesight opposed to eyesight, with the
advantage of deliberate measurement. In ventriloquism
we have the hearing at variance with all the
other senses, and especially with the sight, which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
sometimes contradicted by it in a very extraordinary
and surprising manner, as when the voice is made to
seem to issue from an inanimate and motionless object.
If we plunge our hands, one into ice-cold water, and
the other into water as hot as can be borne, and,
after letting them stay awhile, suddenly transfer
them both to a vessel full of water at a blood heat,
the one will feel a sensation of heat, the other of
cold. And if we cross the two first fingers of one
hand, and place a pea in the fork between them,
moving and rolling it about on a table, we shall
(especially if we close our eyes) be fully persuaded
we have two peas. If the nose be held while we
are eating cinnamon, we shall perceive no difference
between its flavour and that of a deal shaving.</p>

<p>(73.) These, and innumerable instances we might
cite, will convince us, that though we are never deceived
in the <em>sensible impression</em> made by external
objects on us, yet in forming our judgments of them
we are greatly at the mercy of circumstances,
which either modify the impressions actually received,
or combine them with adjuncts which have
become habitually associated with different judgments;
and, therefore, that, in estimating the degree
of confidence we are to place in our conclusions,
we must, of necessity, take into account these modifying
or accompanying circumstances, whatever they
may be. We do not, of course, here speak of deranged
organization; such as, for instance, a distortion of the
eye, producing double vision, and still less of mental
delusion, which absolutely perverts the meaning of
sensible impressions.</p>

<p>(74.) As the mind exists not in the place of sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
objects, and is not brought into immediate relation
with them, we can only regard sensible
impressions as signals conveyed from them by a
wonderful, and, to us, inexplicable mechanism, to our
minds, which receives and reviews them, and, by
habit and association, connects them with corresponding
qualities or affections in the objects; just as
a person writing down and comparing the signals of
a telegraph might interpret their meaning. As, for
instance, if he had constantly observed that the
exhibition of a certain signal was sure to be followed
next day by the announcement of the arrival of a
ship at Portsmouth, he would connect the two facts
by a link of the very same nature with that which
connects the notion of a large wooden building, filled
with sailors, with the impression of her outline on
the retina of a spectator on the beach.</p>

<p>(75.) In captain Head’s amusing and vivid description
of his journey across the Pampas of South
America occurs an anecdote quite in point. His
guide one day suddenly stopped him, and, pointing
high into the air, cried out, “A lion!” Surprised at
such an exclamation, accompanied with such an act,
he turned up his eyes, and with difficulty perceived,
at an immeasurable height, a flight of condors
soaring in circles in a particular spot. Beneath
that spot, far out of sight of himself or guide, lay
the carcass of a horse, and over that carcass stood
(as the guide well knew) the lion, whom the condors
were eyeing with envy from their airy height.
The signal of the birds was to him what the sight
of the lion alone could have been to the traveller,
a full assurance of its existence.</p>

<p class="center b2">OF THE ANALYSIS OF PHENOMENA</p>

<p class="in0">(76.) <i><span class="smcap"><span class="flet">P</span>henomena</span></i>, then, or appearances, as the word
is literally rendered, are the sensible results of
processes and operations carried on among external
objects, or their constituent principles, of which they
are only signals, conveyed to our minds as aforesaid.
Now, these processes themselves may be in many instances
rendered <em>sensible</em>; that is to say, analysed,
and shown to consist in the motions or other affections
of sensible objects themselves. For instance, the phenomenon
of the sound produced by a musical string,
or a bell, when struck, may be shown to be the result
of a process consisting in the rapid vibratory motion
of its parts communicated to the air, and thence to
our ears; though the immediate effect on our organs
of hearing does not excite the least idea of such a
motion. On the other hand, there are innumerable
instances of sensible impressions which (at least at
present) we are incapable of tracing beyond the
mere sensation; for example, in the sensations of
bitterness, sweetness, &amp;c. These, accordingly, if
we were inclined to form hasty decisions, might be
regarded as ultimate qualities; but the instance of
sounds, just adduced, alone would teach us caution
in such decisions, and incline us to believe them
mere results of some secret process going on in
our organs of taste, which is too subtle for us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
trace. A simple experiment will serve to set this
in a clearer light. A solution of the salt called by
chemists <em>nitrate of silver</em>, and another of the <em>hyposulphite
of soda</em>, have each of them separately, when
taken into the mouth, a disgustingly bitter taste;
but if they be mixed, or if one be tasted before the
mouth is thoroughly cleared of the other, the sensible
impression is that of intense sweetness. Again,
the salt called <em>tungstate of soda</em> when first tasted is
sweet, but speedily changes to an intense and pure
bitter, like quassia.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>(77.) How far we may ever be enabled to attain a
knowledge of the ultimate and inward processes of
nature in the production of phenomena, we have no
means of knowing; but, to judge from the degree of
obscurity which hangs about the only case in which
we feel within ourselves a <em>direct</em> power to produce
any one, there seems no great hope of penetrating
so far. The case alluded to is the production of
motion by the exertion of force. We are conscious
of a power to move our limbs, and by their intervention
other bodies; and that this effect is the
result of a certain inexplicable process which we
are aware of, but can no way describe in words, by
which we exert <em>force</em>. And even when such exertion
produces no visible effect, (as when we press
our two hands violently together, so as just to oppose
each other’s effort,) we still perceive, by the
fatigue and exhaustion, and by the impossibility of
maintaining the effort long, that something is going
on within us, of which the mind is the agent, and
the will the determining cause. This impression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
which we receive of the nature of force, from our
own effort and our sense of fatigue, is quite different
from that which we obtain of it from seeing the
effect of force exerted by others in producing <em>motion</em>.
Were there no such thing as motion, had
we been from infancy shut up in a dark dungeon,
and every limb encrusted with plaster, this internal
consciousness would give us a complete idea of
<em>force</em>; but when set at liberty, habit alone would
enable us to recognize its exertion by its <em>signal</em>,
motion, and <em>that</em> only by finding that the same
action of the mind which in our confined state enables
us to fatigue and exhaust ourselves by the
tension of our muscles, puts it in our power, when
at liberty, to move ourselves and other bodies. But
how obscure is our knowledge of the process going
on within us in the exercise of this important privilege,
in virtue of which alone we act as direct <em>causes</em>,
we may judge from this, that when we put any limb
in motion, the seat of the exertion seems to us to
be <em>in</em> the limb, whereas it is demonstrably no such
thing, but either in the brain or in the spinal
marrow; the proof of which is, that if a little fibre,
called a nerve, which forms a communication between
the limb and the brain, or spine, be divided in any
part of its course, however we may make the effort,
the limb will not move.</p>

<p>(78.) This one instance of the obscurity which
hangs about the only act of direct <em>causation</em> of
which we have an immediate consciousness, will
suffice to show how little prospect there is that,
in our investigation of nature, we shall ever be able
to arrive at a knowledge of ultimate causes, and will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
teach us to limit our views to that of <em>laws</em>, and to
the analysis of complex phenomena by which they
are resolved into simpler ones, which, appearing to
us incapable of further analysis, we must consent
to regard as causes. Nor let any one complain of
this as a limitation of his faculties. We have here
“ample room and verge enough” for the full exercise
of all the powers we possess; and, besides, it
does so happen, that we are actually able to trace
up a very large portion of the phenomena of the universe
to this one <em>cause</em>, viz. the exertion of mechanical
<em>force</em>; indeed, so large a portion, that it has
been made a matter of speculation whether this is
not the only one that is capable of acting on material
beings.</p>

<p>(79.) What we mean by the analysis of complex
phenomena into simpler ones, will best be understood
by an instance. Let us, therefore, take the
phenomenon of sound, and, by considering the
various cases in which sounds of all kinds are produced,
we shall find that they all agree in these
points:—1st, The excitement of a motion in the
sounding body. 2dly, The communication of this
motion to the air or other intermedium which is
interposed between the sounding body and our
ears. 3dly, The propagation of such motion from
particle to particle of such intermedium in due
succession. 4thly, Its communication, from the particles
of the intermedium adjacent to the ear, to
the ear itself. 5thly, Its conveyance in the ear, by a
certain mechanism, to the auditory nerves. 6thly, The
excitement of sensation. Now, in this analysis, we
perceive that two principal matters must be understood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
before we can have a true and complete
knowledge of sound:—1st, The excitement and
propagation of motion. 2dly, The production of
sensation. These, then, are two other phenomena,
of a simpler, or, it would be more correct to say, of
a more general or elementary order, into which
the complex phenomenon of sound resolves itself.
But again, if we consider the communication of
motion from body to body, or from one part to
another of the same, we shall perceive that it is
again resolvable into several other phenomena.
1st, The original setting in motion of a material
body, or any part of one. 2dly, The behaviour
of a particle set in motion, when it meets another
lying in its way, or is otherwise impeded or influenced
by its connection with surrounding particles.
3dly, The behaviour of the particles so impeding
or influencing it under such circumstances; besides
which, the last two point out another phenomenon,
which it is necessary also to consider, viz. the phenomenon
of the connection of the parts of material
bodies in masses, by which they form aggregates,
and are enabled to influence each other’s motions.</p>

<p>(80.) Thus, then, we see that an analysis of the
phenomenon of sound leads to the enquiry, 1st, of
two <em>causes</em>, viz. the cause of motion, and the cause
of sensation, these being phenomena which (at least
as human knowledge stands at present) we are
unable to analyse further; and, therefore, we set
them down as simple, elementary, and referable,
for any thing we can see to the contrary, to the
immediate action of their causes. 2dly, Of several
questions relating to the connection between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
motion of material bodies and its cause, such as,
<em>What will happen</em> when a moving body is surrounded
on all sides by others not in motion? <em>What
will happen</em> when a body not in motion is advanced
upon by a moving one? It is evident that the
answers to such questions as these can be no
other than <em>laws of motion</em>, in the sense we have
above attributed to laws of nature, viz. a statement
in words of what will happen in such and such
proposed general contingencies. Lastly, we are
led, by pursuing the analysis, and considering the
phenomenon of the aggregation of the parts of
material bodies, and the way in which they influence
each other, to two other general phenomena,
viz., the cohesion and elasticity of matter;
and these we have no means of analysing further,
and must, therefore, regard them (till we see
reasons to the contrary) as <em>ultimate phenomena</em>,
and referable to the direct action of causes, viz.
an attractive and a repulsive <em>force</em>.</p>

<p>(81.) Of force, as counterbalanced by opposing
force, we have, as already said, an internal consciousness;
and though it may seem strange to us
that matter should be capable of exerting on matter
the same kind of effort, which, judging alone
from this consciousness, we might be led to regard
as a mental one; yet we cannot refuse the
direct evidence of our senses, which shows us
that when we keep a spring stretched with one
hand, we feel our effort opposed exactly in the same
way as if we had ourselves opposed it with the
other hand, or as it would be by that of another
person. The enquiry, therefore, into the aggregation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of matter resolves itself into the general
question, What will be the behaviour of material
particles under the mutual action of opposing
forces capable of counterbalancing each other?
and the answer to this question can be no other
than the announcement of the <em>law</em> of equilibrium,
whatever law that may be.</p>

<p>(82.) With regard to the cause of sensation, it
must be regarded as much more obscure than that
of motion, inasmuch as we have no conscious knowledge
of it, <i>i. e.</i> we have no power, by any act of
our minds and will, to call up a sensation. It is
true, we are not destitute of an approach to it,
since, by an effort of memory and imagination, we can
produce in our minds an impression, or idea, of a
sensation which, in peculiar cases, may even approach
in vividness to actual reality. In dreams, too,
and, in some cases of disordered nerves, we have
sensations without objects. But if force, as a cause
of motion, is obscure to us, even while we are in the
act of exercising it, how much more so is this
other cause, whose exercise we can only imitate
imperfectly by any voluntary act, and of whose
purely internal action we are only fully conscious
when in a state that incapacitates us from reasoning,
and almost from observation!</p>

<p>(83.) Dismissing, then, as beyond our reach, the
enquiry into causes, we must be content at present
to concentrate our attention on the laws which prevail
among phenomena, and which seem to be their
immediate results. From the instance we have just
given, we may perceive that every enquiry into the
intimate nature of a complex phenomenon branches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
out into as many different and distinct enquiries as
there are simple or elementary phenomena into
which it may be analysed; and that, therefore, it
would greatly assist us in our study of nature, if we
could, by any means, ascertain what <em>are</em> the ultimate
phenomena into which all the composite ones
presented by it may be resolved. There is, however,
clearly no way by which this can be ascertained
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i>. We must go to nature itself, and be
guided by the same kind of rule as the chemist in
his analysis, who accounts every ingredient an <em>element</em>
till it can be decompounded and resolved into
others. So, in natural philosophy, we must account
every phenomenon an elementary or simple one till
we can analyse it, and show that it is the result of
others, which in their turn become elementary.
Thus, in a modified and relative sense, we may
still continue to speak of causes, not intending
thereby those ultimate principles of action on whose
exertion the whole frame of nature depends, but
of those proximate links which connect phenomena
with others of a simpler, higher, and more
general or elementary kind. For example: we
may regard the vibration of a musical string as
the proximate cause of the sound it yields, receiving
it, so far, as an ultimate fact, and waving or deferring
enquiry into the cause of vibrations, which
is of a higher and more general nature.</p>

<p>(84.) Moreover, as in chemistry we are sometimes
compelled to acknowledge the existence of
elements different from those already identified and
known, though we cannot insulate them, and to
perceive that substances have the characters of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
compounds, and must therefore be susceptible of
analysis, though we do not see how it is to be
set about; so, in physics, we may perceive the
complexity of a phenomenon, without being able
to perform its analysis. For example: in magnetism,
the agency of electricity is clearly made
out, and they are shown to stand to one another in
the relation of effect and cause. But the analysis
of magnetism, in its relation to particular metals,
is not yet quite satisfactorily performed; and
we are compelled to admit the existence of some
cause, whether proximate or ultimate, whose presence
in different metals, or in different states of
the same metal, determines that peculiar electric
condition which constitutes permanent magnetism.
Cases like these, of all which science presents, offer
the highest interest. They excite enquiry, like the
near approach to the solution of an enigma; they
show us that there is light, could only a certain veil
be drawn aside.</p>

<p>(85.) In pursuing the analysis of any phenomenon,
the moment we find ourselves stopped by
one of which we perceive no analysis, and which,
therefore, we are forced to refer (at least provisionally)
to the class of ultimate facts, and to regard as
elementary, the study of that phenomenon and of
its laws becomes a separate branch of science. If
we encounter the same elementary phenomenon in
the analysis of several composite ones, it becomes
still more interesting, and assumes additional importance;
while at the same time we acquire information
respecting the phenomenon itself, by observing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
those with which it is habitually associated,
that may help us at length to its analysis. It is
thus that sciences increase, and acquire a mutual
relation and dependency. It is thus, too,
that we are at length enabled to trace parallels
and analogies between great branches of science
themselves, which at length terminate in a perception
of their dependence on some common phenomenon
of a more general and elementary nature
than that which form the subject of either separately.
It was thus, for example, that, previous
to Oërsted’s great discovery of electro-magnetism,
a general resemblance between the two sciences of
electricity and magnetism was recognised, and
many of the chief phenomena in each were ascertained
to have their parallels, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>, in
the other. It was thus, too, that an analogy subsisting
between sound and light has been gradually
traced into a closeness of agreement, which can
hardly leave any reasonable doubt of their ultimate
coincidence in one common phenomenon, the
vibratory motion of an elastic medium. If it be
allowed to pursue our illustration from chemistry,
and to ground its application not on what has been,
but on what may one day be, done, it is thus that
the general family resemblance between certain
groups of bodies, now regarded as elementary,
(as nickel and cobalt, for instance, chlorine, iode,
and brome,) will, perhaps, lead us hereafter to perceive
relations between them of a more intimate
kind than we can at present trace.</p>

<p>(86.) On those phenomena which are most frequently
encountered in an analysis of nature and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
which most decidedly resist further decomposition,
it is evident that the greatest pains and attention
ought to be bestowed, not only because they furnish
a key to the greatest number of enquiries, and
serve to group and classify together the greatest
range of phenomena, but by reason of their higher
nature, and because it is in these that we must
look for the direct action of causes, and the most
extensive and general enunciation of the laws of
nature. These, once discovered, place in our power
the explanation of all particular facts, and become
grounds of reasoning, independent of particular
trial: thus playing the same part in natural philosophy
that axioms do in geometry; containing, in a
refined and condensed state, and as it were in a
quintessence, all that our reason has occasion to
draw from experience to enable it to follow out
the truths of physics by the mere application of
logical argument. Indeed, the axioms of geometry
themselves may be regarded as in some sort an
appeal to experience, not corporeal, but mental.
When we say, the whole is greater than its part,
we announce a general fact, which rests, it is
true, on our ideas of whole and part; but, in abstracting
these notions, we begin by considering
them as subsisting in space, and time, and body,
and again, in linear, and superficial, and solid space.
Again, when we say, the equals of equals are equal,
we mentally make comparisons, in equal spaces,
equal times, &amp;c.; so that these axioms, however
self-evident, are still general propositions so far of
the inductive kind, that, independently of experience,
they would not present themselves to the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
The only difference between these and axioms obtained
from extensive induction is this, that, in
raising the axioms of geometry, the instances offer
themselves spontaneously, and without the trouble
of search, and are few and simple; in raising
those of nature, they are infinitely numerous, complicated,
and remote; so that the most diligent
research and the utmost acuteness are required
to unravel their web, and place their meaning in
evidence.</p>

<p>(87.) By far the most general phenomenon with
which we are acquainted, and that which occurs
most constantly, in every enquiry into which we
enter, is motion, and its communication. Dynamics,
then, or the science of force and motion, is thus
placed at the head of all the sciences; and, happily
for human knowledge, it is one in which
the highest certainty is attainable, a certainty no
way inferior to mathematical demonstration. As
its axioms are few, simple, and in the highest degree
distinct and definite, so they have at the same
time an immediate relation to geometrical quantity,
space, time, and direction, and thus accommodate
themselves with remarkable facility to geometrical
reasoning. Accordingly, their consequences may be
pursued, by arguments purely mathematical, to any
extent, insomuch that the limit of our knowledge
of dynamics is determined only by that of pure
mathematics, which is the case in no other branch of
physical science.</p>

<p>(88.) But, it will now be asked, how we are to
proceed to analyse a composite phenomenon into
simpler ones, and whether any general rules can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
given for this important process? We answer, None;
any more than (to pursue the illustration we have
already had recourse to) general rules can be laid
down by the chemist for the analysis of substances
of which all the ingredients are unknown. Such
rules, could they be discovered, would include the
whole of natural science; but we are very far, indeed,
from being able to propound them. However, we
are to recollect that the analysis of phenomena,
philosophically speaking, is principally useful, as it
enables us to recognize, and mark for special investigation,
those which appear to us simple; to set methodically
about determining their laws, and thus to
facilitate the work of raising up general axioms, or
forms of words, which shall include the whole of
them; which shall, as it were, transplant them out of
the external into the intellectual world, render them
creatures of pure thought, and enable us to reason
them out <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i>. And what renders the power of
doing this so eminently desirable is, that, in thus
reasoning back from generals to particulars, the propositions
at which we arrive apply to an immense
multitude of combinations and cases, which were
never individually contemplated in the mental process
by which our axioms were first discovered; and
that, consequently, when our reasonings are pushed
to the utmost limit of particularity, their results
appear in the form of <em>individual facts</em>, of which we
might have had no knowledge from immediate experience;
and thus we are not only furnished with the
explanation of all known facts, but with the actual
discovery of such as were before unknown. A remarkable
example of this has already been mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
in Fresnel’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> discovery of the extraordinary
refraction of both rays in a doubly refracting medium.
To give another example:—The law of gravitation
is a physical axiom of a very high and universal
kind, and has been raised by a succession of inductions
and abstractions drawn from the observation of
numerous facts and subordinate laws in the planetary
system. When this law is taken for granted, and
laid down as a basis of reasoning, and applied to
the actual condition of our own planet, one of the
consequences to which it leads is, that the earth,
instead of being an exact sphere, must be compressed
or flattened in the direction of its polar diameter,
the one diameter being about thirty miles shorter
than the other; and this conclusion, deduced at
first by mere reasoning, has been since found to be
true in fact. All astronomical predictions are
examples of the same thing.</p>

<p>(89.) In the important business of raising these
axioms of nature, we are not, as in the analysis of
phenomena, left wholly without a guide. The nature
of abstract or general reasoning points out in
a great measure the course we must pursue. A
law of nature, being the statement of what will
happen in certain general contingencies, may be
regarded as the announcement, in the same words,
of a whole group or class of phenomena. Whenever,
therefore, we perceive that two or more phenomena
agree in so many or so remarkable points, as
to lead us to regard them as forming a class or group,
if we lay out of consideration, or <em>abstract</em>, all the circumstances
in which they disagree, and retain in
our minds those only in which they agree, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
then, under this kind of mental convention, frame a
definition or statement of one of them, in such words
that it shall apply equally to them all, such statement
will appear in the form of a general proposition,
having so far at least the character of a law of
nature.</p>

<p>(90.) For example: a great number of transparent
substances, when exposed, in a certain particular
manner, to a beam of light which has been
prepared by undergoing certain reflexions or refractions,
(and has thereby acquired peculiar properties,
and is said to be “<em>polarized</em>,”) exhibit very vivid
and beautiful colours, disposed in streaks, bands,
&amp;c. of great regularity, which seem to arise within
the substance, and which, from a certain regular
succession observed in their appearance, are called
“periodical colours.” Among the substances which
exhibit these periodical colours occur a great
variety of transparent solids, but no fluids and no
opake solids. Here, then, there seems to be sufficient
community of nature to enable us to use a
general term, and to state the proposition as a law,
viz. <em>transparent solids</em> exhibit periodical colours by
exposure to polarized light. However, this, though
true of many, does not apply to <em>all</em> transparent
solids, and therefore we cannot state it as a general
truth or law of nature in this form; although the
reverse proposition, that all solids which exhibit
such colours in such circumstances are <em>transparent</em>,
would be correct and general. It becomes
necessary, then, to make a list of those to which it
does apply; and thus a great number of substances
of all kinds become grouped together, in a class<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
linked by this common property. If we examine
the individuals of this group, we find among them
the utmost variety of colour, texture, weight, hardness,
form and composition; so that, in these respects,
we seem to have fallen upon an assemblage
of contraries. But when we come to examine
them closely, in all their properties, we find they
have all one point of agreement, in the property of
double refraction, (see page <a href="#Page_30">30</a>.) and therefore we
may describe them all truly as <em>doubly refracting
substances</em>. We may, therefore, state the fact in the
form, “Doubly refracting substances exhibit periodical
colours by exposure to polarized light;”
and in this form it is found, on further examination,
to be true, not only for those particular instances
which we had in view when we first propounded it,
but in all cases which have since occurred on further
enquiry, without a single exception; so that the
proposition is general, and entitled to be regarded
as a law of nature.</p>

<p>(91.) We may therefore regard a law of nature
either, 1st, as a general proposition, announcing, in
abstract terms, a whole group of particular facts relating
to the behaviour of natural agents in proposed
circumstances; or, 2dly, as a proposition announcing
that a whole class of individuals agreeing in one
character agree also in another. For example: in
the case before us, the law arrived at includes, in
its general announcement, among others, the particular
facts, that rock crystal and saltpetre exhibit periodical
colours; for these are both of them doubly
refracting substances. Or, it may be regarded
as announcing a relation between the two phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
of double refraction, and the exhibition of
periodical colours; which in the actual case is one
of the most important, viz. the relation of <em>constant
association</em>, inasmuch as it asserts that in whatever
individual the one character is found, the other will
invariably be found also.</p>

<p>(92.) These two lights, in which the announcement
of a general law may be regarded, though at
bottom they come to the same thing, yet differ
widely in their influence on our minds. The former
exhibits a law as little more than a kind of artificial
memory; but in the latter it becomes a step
in philosophical investigation, leading directly to the
consideration of a proximate, if not an ultimate,
cause; inasmuch as, whenever two phenomena are
observed to be invariably connected together, we
conclude them to be related to each other, either
as cause and effect, or as common effects of a single
cause.</p>

<p>(93.) There is still another light in which we
may regard a law of the kind in question, viz. as a
proposition asserting the mutual connection, or in
some cases the entire identity, of two classes of individuals
(whether individual objects or individual
facts); and this is, perhaps, the simplest and most
instructive way in which it can be conceived,
and that which furnishes the readiest handle to
further generalization in the raising of yet higher
axioms. For example: in the case above mentioned,
if observation had enabled us to establish
the existence of a class of bodies possessing the
property of double refraction, and observations
of another kind had, independently of the former, led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
as to recognize a class possessing that of the exhibition
of periodical colours in polarized light, a mere
comparison of lists would at once demonstrate the
identity of the two classes, or enable us to ascertain
whether one was or was not included in the other.</p>

<p>(94.) It is thus we perceive the high importance
in physical science of just and accurate classifications
of particular facts, or individual objects, under
general well considered heads or points of agreement
(for which there are none better adapted
than the simple phenomena themselves into which
they can be analysed in the first instance); for by
so doing each of such phenomena, or heads of
classification, becomes not a particular but a general
fact; and when we have amassed a great store of
such <em>general facts</em>, they become the objects of another
and higher species of classification, and are
themselves included in laws which, as they dispose
of groups, not individuals, have a far superior
degree of generality, till at length, by continuing
the process, we arrive at <em>axioms</em> of the
highest degree of generality of which science is
capable.</p>

<p>(95.) This process is what we mean by induction;
and, from what has been said, it appears that induction
may be carried on in two different ways,—either
by the simple juxta-position and comparison
of ascertained classes, and marking their agreements
and disagreements; or by considering the
individuals of a class, and casting about, as it were
to find in what particular they all agree, besides
that which serves as their principle of classification.
Either of these methods may be put in practice as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
one or the other may afford facilities in any case;
but it will naturally happen that, where facts
are numerous, well observed, and methodically
arranged, the former will be more applicable than
in the contrary case: the one is better adapted to
the maturity, the other to the infancy, of science:
the one employs, as an engine, the division of
labour; the other mainly relies on individual penetration,
and requires a union of many branches of
knowledge in one person.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">OF THE STATE OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE IN GENERAL, PREVIOUS
TO THE AGE OF GALILEO AND BACON.</p>

<p class="in0">(96.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">I</span>t</span> is to our immortal countryman Bacon
that we owe the broad announcement of this grand
and fertile principle; and the developement of the
idea, that the whole of natural philosophy consists
entirely of a series of inductive generalizations,
commencing with the most circumstantially stated
particulars, and carried up to universal laws, or
axioms, which comprehend in their statements
every subordinate degree of generality, and of a
corresponding series of inverted reasoning from
generals to particulars, by which these axioms are
traced back into their remotest consequences, and
all particular propositions deduced from them; as
well those by whose immediate consideration we
rose to their discovery, as those of which we had
no previous knowledge. In the course of this
descent to particulars, we must of necessity encounter
all those facts on which the arts and works
that tend to the accommodation of human life
depend, and acquire thereby the command of an
unlimited practice, and a disposal of the powers
of nature co-extensive with those powers themselves.
A noble promise, indeed, and one which
ought, surely, to animate us to the highest exertion
of our faculties; especially since we have already
such convincing proof that it is neither vain nor
rash, but, on the contrary, has been, and continues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
to be, fulfilled, with a promptness and liberality
which even its illustrious author in his most sanguine
mood would have hardly ventured to anticipate.</p>

<p>(97.) Previous to the publication of the Novum
Organum of Bacon, natural philosophy, in any
legitimate and extensive sense of the word, could
hardly be said to exist. Among the Greek philosophers,
of whose attainments in science alone,
in the earlier ages of the world, we have any positive
knowledge, and that but a very limited one,
we are struck with the remarkable contrast between
their powers of acute and subtle disputation,
their extraordinary success in abstract reasoning,
and their intimate familiarity with subjects
purely intellectual, on the one hand; and, on the
other, with their loose and careless consideration
of external nature, their grossly illogical deductions
of principles of sweeping generality from
few and ill-observed facts, in some cases; and their
reckless assumption of abstract principles having
no foundation but in their own imaginations, in
others; mere forms of words, with nothing corresponding
to them in nature, from which, as from
mathematical definitions, postulates, and axioms,
they imagined that all phenomena could be derived,
all the laws of nature deduced. Thus, for
instance, having settled it in their own minds, that
a circle is the most perfect of figures, they concluded,
of course, that the movements of the heavenly
bodies must all be performed in exact circles, and
with uniform motions; and when the plainest observation
demonstrated the contrary, instead of
doubting the principle, they saw no better way of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
getting out of the difficulty than by having recourse
to endless combinations of circular motions to preserve
their ideal perfection.</p>

<p>(98.) Undoubtedly among the Greek philosophers
were many men of transcendent talents and virtues,
the ornaments of their species, and justly entitled to
the veneration of all posterity; but regarded as a body
they can hardly be considered otherwise than as a
knot of disputatious candidates for popular favour,
too busy in maintaining their ascendency over their
followers and admirers, by an ostentatious display of
superior knowledge, to have the leisure (had they
always the inclination) to base their pretensions on
a deep and sure foundation, and yet too sensible of
the disgrace and inconvenience of failure, not to
defend their dogmas, however shallow, when once
promulgated, against their keen and sagacious opponents,
by every art of sophism or appeal to passion.
Hence the crudities and chimerical views with
which their systems of philosophy, both natural and
moral, were overloaded; their endless disputes
about verbal subtleties, and, last and worst, the
proud assumption with which they sheltered ignorance
and indolence under the screen of unintelligible
jargon or dogmatical assertion. Perhaps, however,
this character applies rather to the later than
to the earlier of the Greek philosophers. The spirit
of rational enquiry into nature seems, if we can
judge from the uncertain and often contradictory
notices handed down to us of their tenets, to have
been far more alive, and less warped by this vain
and arrogant turn, then than at a later period. We
know not now what was the precise meaning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
attached by Thales to his opinion, that water was
the origin of all things; but modern geologists will
not be at a loss to conceive how an observant traveller
might become impressed with this notion,
without having recourse to the mystic records of
Egypt or Chaldea. His ideas of eclipses and of the
nature of the moon were sound; and his prediction
of an eclipse of the sun, in particular, was attended
with circumstances so remarkable as to have made
it a matter of important investigation to modern astronomers.
Anaxagoras, among a number of crude
and imperfectly explained notions, speculated rationally
enough on the cause of the winds and of
the rainbow, and less absurdly on earthquakes than
many modern geologists have done, and appears generally
to have had his attention alive to nature, and
his mind open to just reasoning on its phenomena;
while Pythagoras, whether he reasoned it out for himself,
or borrowed the notion from Egypt or India, had
attained a just conception of the general disposition
of the parts of the solar system, and the place held
by the earth in it; nay, according to some accounts,
had even raised his views so far as to speculate on
the attraction of the sun as the bond of its union.</p>

<p>(99.) But the successors of these <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bonâ fide</i> enquirers
into nature debased the standard of truth;
and, taking advantage of the credit justly attached to
their discoveries, renounced the modest character of
learners, and erected themselves into teachers, and, to
maintain their pretensions to this character, adopted
the tone of men who had nothing further to learn.
Unfortunately for true science, the national character
gave every encouragement to pretensions of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
kind. That restless craving after novelty, which
distinguished the Greeks in their civil and political
relations, pursued them into their philosophy. Whatever
speculations were only ingenious and new had
irresistible charms; and the teacher who could embody
a clever thought in elegant language, or at
once save his followers and himself the trouble of
thinking or reasoning, by bold assertion, was too
often induced to acquire cheaply the reputation of
superior knowledge, snatch a few superficial notions
from the most ordinary and obvious facts, envelope
them in a parade of abstruse words, declare them
the primary and ultimate principles of all things,
and denounce as absurd and impious all opinions
opposed to his own.</p>

<p>(100.) In this war of words the study of nature
was neglected, and an humble and patient enquiry
after facts altogether despised, as unworthy of the
high <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">priori</i> ground a true philosopher ought to take.
It was the radical error of the Greek philosophy to
imagine that the same method which proved so eminently
successful in mathematical, would be equally
so in physical, enquiries, and that, by setting out
from a few simple and almost self-evident notions, or
<em>axioms</em>, every thing could be reasoned out. Accordingly,
we find them constantly straining their invention
to discover these principles, which were to prove
so pregnant. One makes <em>fire</em> the essential matter
and origin of the universe; another, <em>air</em>; a third,
discovers the key to every difficulty, and the explanation
of all phenomena, in the “<span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">το απειρον</span>” or
infinitude of things; a fourth, in the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">το ὁν</span> and
the <span xml:lang="grc" lang="grc">το μη ὁν</span>, that is to say, in entity and nonentity;—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>till
at length an authority, which was destined to
command opinions for nearly two thousand years,
settled this important point, by deciding, that <em>matter</em>,
<em>form</em>, and <em>privation</em>, were to be considered the principles
of all things.</p>

<p>(101.) It were to do injustice to Aristotle, however,
to judge of him by <em>such</em> a sample of his philosophy.
He, at least, saw the necessity of having recourse
to nature for something like principles of physical
science; and, as an observer, a collector
and recorder of facts and phenomena, stood without
an equal in his age. It was the fault of that
age, and of the perverse and flimsy style of verbal
disputation which had infected all learning, rather
than his own, that he allowed himself to be contented
with vague and loose notions drawn from
general and vulgar observation, in place of seeking
carefully, in well arranged and thoroughly considered
instances, for the true laws of nature. His
voluminous works, on every department of human
knowledge existing in his time, have nearly all
perished. From his work on animals, which has
descended to us, we are, however, enabled to appreciate
his powers of observation; and a parallel
drawn by an eminent Oxford professor between his
classifications and those of the most illustrious of
living naturalists, shows him to have attained a
view of animated nature in a remarkable degree
comprehensive, and which contrasts strikingly with
the confusion, vagueness, and assumption of his
physical opinions and dogmas. In these it is easy
to recognize a mind not at home, and an impression
of the necessity of saying something learned and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
systematic, without knowing what to say. Thus
he divides motions into natural and unnatural; the
natural motion of fire and light bodies being upwards,
those of heavy downwards, each seeking its
kindred nature in the heavens and the earth. Thus,
too, the immediate impressions made on us by external
objects, such as hardness, colour, heat, &amp;c.
are referred at once, in the Aristotelian philosophy,
to occult qualities, in virtue of which they are as
they are, and beyond which it is useless to enquire.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Of course there will occur a limit beyond which
it <em>is</em> useless for merely human faculties to enquire;
but where that limit is placed, experience alone can
teach us; and at least to assert that we <em>have</em> attained
it, is now universally recognized as the sure criterion
of dogmatism.</p>

<p>(102.) In the early ages of the church the writings
of Aristotle were condemned, as allowing too
much to reason and sense; and even so late as the
twelfth century they were sought out and burned,
and their readers excommunicated. By degrees,
however, the extreme injustice of this impeachment
of their character was acknowledged: they became
the favourite study of the schoolmen, and furnished
the keenest weapons of their controversy, being
appealed to in all disputes as of sovereign authority;
so that the slightest dissent from any opinion
of the “great master,” however absurd or unintelligible,
was at once drowned by clamour, or
silenced by the still more effectual argument of
bitter persecution. If the logic of that gloomy
period could be justly described as “the art of talking
unintelligibly on matters of which we are ignorant,”
its physics might, with equal truth, be summed up
in a deliberate preference of ignorance to knowledge,
in matters of every day’s experience and use.</p>

<p>(103.) In “this opake of nature and of soul,”
the perverse activity of the alchemists from time
to time struck out a doubtful spark<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>; and our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
illustrious countryman, Roger Bacon, shone out at
the obscurest moment, like an early star predicting
dawn. It was not, however, till the sixteenth
century that the light of nature began to break
forth with a regular and progressive increase. The
vaunts of Paracelsus of the power of his chemical
remedies and elixirs, and his open condemnation of
the ancient pharmacy, backed as they were by many
surprising cures, convinced all rational physicians
that chemistry could furnish many excellent remedies,
unknown till that time<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>, and a number of
valuable experiments began to be made by physicians
and chemists, desirous of discovering and
describing new chemical remedies. The chemical
and metallurgic arts, exercised by persons empirically
acquainted with their secrets, began to be
seriously studied with a view to the acquisition of
rational and useful knowledge, and regular treatises
on branches of natural science at length to
appear. George Agricola, in particular, devoted
himself with ardour to the study of mineralogy
and metallurgy in the mining districts of Bohemia
and Schemnitz, and published copious and methodical
accounts of all the facts within his knowledge:
and our countryman, Dr. Gilbert of Colchester, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
1590, published a treatise on magnetism, full of
valuable facts and experiments, ingeniously reasoned
on; and he likewise extended his enquiries
to a variety of other subjects, in particular to electricity.</p>

<p>(104.) But, as the decisive mark of a great commencing
change in the direction of the human
faculties, astronomy, the only science in which the
ancients had made any real progress, and ascended
to any thing like large and general conceptions,
began once more to be studied in the best spirit
of a candid philosophy; and the Copernican or
Pythagorean system arose or revived, and rapidly
gained advocates. Galileo at length appeared, and
openly attacked and refuted the Aristotelian dogmas
respecting motion, by direct appeal to the evidence
of sense, and by experiments of the most
convincing kind. The persecutions which such a
step drew upon him, the record of his perseverance
and sufferings, and the ultimate triumph of his
opinions and reasonings, have been too lately and
too well related<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> to require repetition here.</p>

<p>(105.) By the discoveries of Copernicus, Kepler,
and Galileo, the errors of the Aristotelian philosophy
were effectually overturned on a plain appeal
to the facts of nature; but it remained to show on
broad and general principles, how and why Aristotle
was in the wrong; to set in evidence the peculiar
weakness of his method of philosophizing, and to
substitute in its place a stronger and better. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
important task was executed by Francis Bacon, Lord
Verulam, who will, therefore, justly be looked upon
in all future ages as the great reformer of philosophy,
though his own actual contributions to the
stock of physical truths were small, and his ideas
of particular points strongly tinctured with mistakes
and errors, which were the fault rather of the
general want of physical information of the age
than of any narrowness of view on his own part;
and of this he was fully aware. It has been attempted
by some to lessen the merit of this great
achievement, by showing that the inductive method
had been practised in many instances, both ancient
and modern, by the mere instinct of mankind; but
it is not the introduction of inductive reasoning, as
a new and hitherto untried process, which characterizes
the Baconian philosophy, but his keen perception,
and his broad and spirit-stirring, almost
enthusiastic, announcement of its paramount importance,
as the alpha and omega of science, as the
grand and only chain for the linking together of
physical truths, and the eventual key to every discovery
and every application. Those who would
deny him his just glory on such grounds would
refuse to Jenner or to Howard their civic crowns,
because a few farmers in a remote province had,
time out of mind, been acquainted with vaccination,
or philanthropists, in all ages, had occasionally
visited the prisoner in his dungeon.</p>

<p>(106.) An immense impulse was now given to science,
and it seemed as if the genius of mankind, long
pent up, had at length rushed eagerly upon Nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
and commenced, with one accord, the great work of
turning up her hitherto unbroken soil, and exposing
the treasures so long concealed. A general sense
now prevailed of the poverty and insufficiency of
existing knowledge in <em>matters of fact</em>; and, as information
flowed fast in, an era of excitement and wonder
commenced, to which the annals of mankind
had furnished nothing similar. It seemed, too, as
if Nature herself seconded the impulse; and, while
she supplied new and extraordinary aids to those
senses which were henceforth to be exercised in
her investigation,—while the telescope and the microscope
laid open <em>the infinite</em> in both directions,—as
if to call attention to her wonders, and signalize
the epoch, she displayed the rarest, the most splendid
and mysterious, of all astronomical phenomena, the
appearance and subsequent total extinction of a
new and brilliant fixed star twice within the lifetime
of Galileo himself.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>(107.) The immediate followers of Bacon and
Galileo ransacked all nature for new and surprising
facts, with something of that craving for the marvellous,
which might be regarded as a remnant of
the age of alchemy and natural magic, but which,
under proper regulation, is a most powerful and
useful stimulus to experimental enquiry. Boyle, in
particular, seemed animated by an enthusiasm of
ardour, which hurried him from subject to subject,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and from experiment to experiment, without a
moment’s intermission, and with a sort of undistinguishing
appetite; while Hooke (the great contemporary,
and almost the worthy rival, of Newton)
carried a keener eye of scrutinizing reason into a
range of research even yet more extensive. As
facts multiplied, leading phenomena became prominent,
laws began to emerge, and generalizations
to commence; and so rapid was the career of discovery,
so signal the triumph of the inductive philosophy,
that a single generation and the efforts
of a single mind sufficed for the establishment of
the system of the universe, on a basis never after
to be shaken.</p>

<p>(108.) We shall now endeavour to enumerate and
explain in detail the principal steps by which legitimate
and extensive inductions are arrived at, and
the processes by which the mind, in the investigation
of natural laws, purges itself by successive
degrees of the superfluities and incumbrances which
hang about particulars, and obscure the perception
of their points of resemblance and connection. We
shall state the helps which may be afforded us, in
a work of so much thought and labour, by a methodical
course of proceeding, and by a careful notice
of those means which have at any time been found
successful, with a view to their better understanding
and adaptation to other cases: a species of mental
induction of no mean utility and extent in itself;
inasmuch as by pursuing it alone we can attain a
more intimate knowledge than we actually possess
of the laws which regulate our discovery of truth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
and of the rules, so far as they extend, to which
invention is reducible. In doing this, we shall
commence at the beginning, with experience itself,
considered as the accumulation of the knowledge
of individual objects and facts.</p>

<p class="center">OF THE OBSERVATION OF FACTS AND THE COLLECTION
OF INSTANCES.</p>

<p class="in0">(109.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">N</span>ature</span> offers us two sorts of subjects of
contemplation in the external world,—objects, and
their mutual actions. But, after what has been said
on the subject of sensation, the reader will be at no
loss to perceive that we know nothing of the objects
themselves which compose the universe, except
through the medium of the impressions they excite
in us, which impressions are the results of certain
actions and processes in which sensible objects
and the material parts of ourselves are directly
concerned. Thus, our observation of external nature
is limited to the mutual action of material objects
on one another; and to facts, that is, the associations
of phenomena or appearances. We gain no
information by perceiving merely that an object is
black; but if we also perceive it to be fluid, we
at least acquire the knowledge that blackness is
not incompatible with fluidity, and have thus made
a step, however trifling, to a knowledge of the more
intimate nature of these two qualities. Whenever,
therefore, we would either analyse a phenomenon into
simpler ones, or ascertain what is the course or law
of nature under any proposed general contingency,
the first step is to accumulate a sufficient quantity
of well ascertained facts or recorded instances,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
bearing on the point in question. Common sense
dictates this, as affording us the means of examining
the same subject in several points of view; and it
would also dictate, that the more different these
collected facts are in all other circumstances but
that which forms the subject of enquiry, the better;
because they are then in some sort brought into
contrast with one another in their points of disagreement,
and thus tend to render those in which
they agree more prominent and striking.</p>

<p>(110.) The only facts which can ever become useful
as grounds of physical enquiry are those which
happen uniformly and invariably under the same
circumstances. This is evident: for if they have
not this character they cannot be included in laws;
they want that universality which fits them to enter
as elementary particles into the constitution of those
universal axioms which we aim at discovering. If one
and the same result does not constantly happen under
a given combination of circumstances, apparently the
same, one of two things must be supposed,—caprice
(<i>i. e.</i> the arbitrary intervention of mental agency), or
differences in the circumstances themselves, really
existing, but unobserved by us. In either case,
though we may record such facts as curiosities, or
as awaiting explanation when the difference of circumstances
shall be understood, we can make no
use of them in scientific enquiry. Hence, whenever
we notice a remarkable effect of any kind, our
first question ought to be, Can it be reproduced?
What are the circumstances under which it has
happened? And will it <em>always</em> happen again if those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
circumstances, so far as we have been able to collect
them, co-exist?</p>

<p>(111.) The circumstances, then, which accompany
any observed fact, are main features in its observation,
at least until it is ascertained by sufficient
experience what circumstances have nothing to do
with it, and might therefore have been left unobserved
without sacrificing <em>the fact</em>. In observing and
recording a fact, therefore, altogether new, we ought
not to omit any circumstance capable of being noted,
lest some one of the omitted circumstances should
be essentially connected with the fact, and its
omission should, therefore, reduce the implied statement
of a <em>law of nature</em> to the mere record of an
<em>historical event</em>. For instance, in the fall of meteoric
stones, flashes of fire are seen proceeding from a
cloud, and a loud rattling noise like thunder is
heard. These circumstances, and the sudden stroke
and destruction ensuing, long caused them to be
confounded with an effect of lightning, and called
thunderbolts. But one circumstance is enough to
mark the difference: the flash and sound have
been perceived occasionally to emanate from a <em>very
small cloud</em> insulated in <em>a clear sky</em>; a combination
of circumstances which never happens in a thunder
storm, but which is undoubtedly intimately connected
with their real origin.</p>

<p>(112.) Recorded observation consists of two distinct
parts: 1st, an exact notice of the thing
observed, and of all the particulars which may be
supposed to have any natural connection with it;
and, 2dly, a true and faithful record of them. As our
senses are the only inlets by which we receive impressions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
of facts, we must take care, in observing,
to have them all in activity, and to let nothing escape
notice which affects any one of them. Thus, if
lightning were to strike the house we inhabit, we
ought to notice what kind of light we saw—whether
a sheet of flame, a darting spark, or a broken zig-zag;
in what direction moving, to what objects adhering,
its colour, its duration, &amp;c.; what sounds were
heard—explosive, crashing, rattling, momentary, or
gradually increasing and fading, &amp;c.; whether any
smell of fire was perceptible, and if sulphureous,
metallic, or such as would arise merely from substances
scorched by the flash, &amp;c.; whether we felt
any shock, stroke, or peculiar sensation, or experienced
any strange taste in our mouths. Then,
besides detailing the effects of the stroke, all the
circumstances which might in any degree seem
likely to attract, produce, or modify it, such as
the presence of conductors, neighbouring objects,
the state of the atmosphere, the barometer, thermometer,
&amp;c., and the disposition of the clouds,
should be noted; and after all this particularity,
the question <em>how</em> the house <em>came to be struck?</em> might
ultimately depend on the fact that a flash of lightning
twenty miles off passed at that particular
moment <em>from the ground to the clouds</em>, by an effect of
what has been termed the returning stroke.</p>

<p>(113.) A writer in the Edinburgh Philosophical
Journal<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> states himself to have been led into a series
of investigations on the chemical nature of a peculiar
acid, by noticing, accidentally, a bitter taste in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
liquid about to be thrown away. Chemistry is full
of such incidents.</p>

<p>(114.) In transient phenomena, if the number of
particulars be great, and the time to observe them
short, we must consult our memory before they
have had time to fade, or refresh it by placing ourselves
as nearly as possible in the same circumstances
again; go back to the spot, for instance, and
try the words of our statement by appeal to all remaining
indications, &amp;c. This is most especially
necessary where we have not observed ourselves,
but only collect and record the observations of others,
particularly of illiterate or prejudiced persons, on any
rare phenomenon, such as the passing of a great
meteor,—the fall of a stone from the sky,—the
shock of an earthquake,—an extraordinary hailstorm,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>(115.) In all cases which admit of numeration or
measurement, it is of the utmost consequence to
obtain precise numerical statements, whether in the
measure of time, space, or quantity of any kind. To
omit this, is, in the first place, to expose ourselves
to illusions of sense which may lead to the grossest
errors. Thus, in alpine countries, we are constantly
deceived in heights and distances; and when we have
overcome the first impression which leads us to
under-estimate them, we are then hardly less apt to
run into the opposite extreme. But it is not merely
in preserving us from exaggerated impressions that
numerical precision is desirable. It is the very soul
of science; and its attainment affords the only criterion,
or at least the best, of the truth of theories,
and the correctness of experiments. Thus, it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
entirely to the omission of exact numerical determinations
of quantity that the mistakes and confusion
of the Stahlian chemistry were attributable,—a
confusion which dissipated like a morning mist as
soon as precision, in this respect, came to be regarded
as essential. Chemistry is in the most pre-eminent
degree a science of quantity; and to enumerate the
discoveries which have arisen in it, from the mere
determination of weights and measures, would be
nearly to give a synopsis of this branch of knowledge.
We need only mention the law of definite
proportions, which fixes the composition of every
body in nature in determinate proportional weights
of its ingredients.</p>

<p>(116.) Indeed, it is a character of all the higher laws
of nature to assume the form of precise <em>quantitative</em>
statement. Thus, the law of gravitation, the most
universal truth at which human reason has yet arrived,
expresses not merely the general fact of the
mutual attraction of all matter; not merely the
vague statement that its influence decreases as the
distance increases, but the exact numerical rate at
which that decrease takes place; so that when its
amount is known at any one distance it may be calculated
exactly for any other. Thus, too, the laws
of crystallography, which limit the forms assumed by
natural substances, when left to their own inherent
powers of aggregation, to precise geometrical figures,
with fixed angles and proportions, have the same
essential character of strict mathematical expression,
without which no exact particular conclusions could
ever be drawn from them.</p>

<p>(117.) But, to arrive at laws of this description, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
evident that every step of our enquiry must be perfectly
free from the slightest degree of looseness
and indecision, and carry with it the full force of
strict numerical announcement; and that, therefore,
the observations themselves on which all laws ultimately
rest ought to have the same property. None
of our senses, however, gives us direct information
for the exact comparison of quantity. Number,
indeed, that is to say, integer number, is an object
of sense, because we can count; but we can
neither weigh, measure, nor form any precise estimate
of fractional parts by the unassisted senses.
Scarcely any man could tell the difference between
twenty pounds and the same weight increased or
diminished by a few ounces; still less could he judge
of the proportion between an ounce of gold and a
hundred grains of cotton by balancing them in his
hands. To take another instance: the eye is no
judge of the proportion of different degrees of illumination,
even when seen side by side; and if an
interval elapses, and circumstances change, nothing
can be more vague than its judgments. When we
gaze with admiration at the gorgeous spectacle of
the golden clouds at sunset, which seem drenched
in light and glowing like flames of real fire, it is
hardly by any effort we can persuade ourselves
to regard them as the very same objects which at
noonday pass unnoticed as mere white clouds basking
in the sun, only participating, from their great horizontal
distance, in the ruddy tint which luminaries
acquire by shining through a great extent of the
vapours of the atmosphere, and thereby even losing
something of their light. So it is with our estimates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of time, velocity, and all other matters of
quantity; they are absolutely vague, and inadequate
to form a foundation for any exact conclusion.</p>

<p>(118.) In this emergency we are obliged to have
recourse to instrumental aids, that is, to contrivances
which shall substitute for the vague impressions
of sense the precise one of number, and reduce all
measurement to counting. As a first preliminary
towards effecting this, we fix on convenient <em>standards</em>
of weight, dimension, time, &amp;c., and invent contrivances
for readily and correctly repeating them as
often as we please, and counting how often such a
standard unit is contained in the thing, be it weight,
space, time, or angle, we wish to measure; and if
there be a fractional part over, we measure this
as a new quantity by aliquot parts of the former
standard.</p>

<p>(119.) If every scientific enquirer observed only
for his own satisfaction, and reasoned only on his
own observations, it would be of little importance
what standards he used, or what contrivances (if
only just ones) he employed for this purpose; but if
it be intended (as it is most important they should)
that observations once made should remain as records
to all mankind, and to all posterity, it is evidently of
the highest consequence that all enquirers should
agree on the use of a common standard, and that
this should be one not liable to change by lapse
of time. The selection and verification of such
standards, however, will easily be understood to be
a matter of extreme difficulty, if only from the mere
circumstance that, to verify the permanence of one
standard, we must compare it with others, which it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
is possible may be themselves inaccurate, or, at least,
stand in need of verification.</p>

<p>(120.) Here we can only call to our assistance
the presumed permanence of the great laws of
Nature, with all experience in its favour, and the
strong impression we have of the general composure
and steadiness of every thing relating to the gigantic
mass we inhabit—“the great globe itself.” In its
uniform rotation on its axis, accordingly, we find a
standard of time, which nothing has ever given us
reason to regard as subject to change, and which,
compared with other periods which the revolutions
of the planets about the sun afford, has demonstrably
undergone none since the earliest history. In the
dimensions of the earth we find a natural unit
of the measure of space, which possesses in perfection
every quality that can be desired; and in
its attraction combined with its rotation the researches
of dynamical science have enabled us,
through the medium of the pendulum, to obtain
another invariable standard, more refined and less
obvious, it is true, in its origin, but possessing a
great advantage in its capability of ready verification,
and therefore easily made to serve as a check on
the other. The former, viz. direct measurement
of the dimensions of the earth, is the origin of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mètre</i>, the French unit of linear measure; the
latter, of the British yard. Theoretically speaking,
they are equally eligible; but when we consider that
the <em>quantity directly measured</em>, in the case of the
mètre, is a length a great many thousand times the
final unit, and in the pendulum or yard very nearly
the unit itself, there can be no hesitation in giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the preference as an original measure to the former,
because any error committed in the process by
which that is determined becomes subdivided in
the final result; while, on the other hand, any minute
error committed in determining the length of
the pendulum becomes multiplied by the repetition
of the unit in all measurements of considerable
lengths performed in yards.</p>

<p>(121.) The same admirable invention of the pendulum
affords a means of subdividing time to an
almost unlimited nicety. A clock is nothing more
than a piece of mechanism for counting the oscillations
of a pendulum; and by that peculiar property
of the pendulum, that one vibration commences
exactly where the last terminates, no part of time is
lost or gained in the juxta-position of the units so
counted, so that the precise fractional part of a day
can be ascertained which each such unit measures.</p>

<p>(122.) It is owing to this peculiar property by
which the <em>juxta-position</em> of units of time and weight
can be performed <em>without error</em>, that the whole of
the accuracy with which time and weight can be
multiplied and subdivided is owing.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> The same
thing cannot be accomplished in <em>space</em>, by any method<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
we are yet acquainted with, so that our means of
subdividing space are much inferior in precision.
The beautiful principle of repetition, invented by
Borda, offers the nearest approach to it, but cannot
be said to be absolutely free from the source of error
in question. The method of “double weighing,”
which we owe to the same distinguished observer,
affords an instance of the direct comparison of two
equal weights independent of almost every source of
error which can affect the comparison of one object
with another. It has been remarked by Biot, that
previous to the invention of this elegant method, instruments
afforded no perfect means of ascertaining
the weight of a body.</p>

<p>(123.) But it is not enough to possess a standard
of this abstract kind: a real material measure must
be constructed, and exact copies of it taken. This,
however, is not very difficult; the great difficulty is
to preserve it unaltered from age to age; for unless
we transmit to posterity the units of our measurements,
<em>such as we have ourselves used them</em>, we, in
fact, only half bequeath to them our observations.
This is a point too much lost sight of, and it were
much to be wished that some direct provision for
so important an object were made.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
(124.) But, it may be asked, if our measurement of
quantity is thus unavoidably liable to error, how is
it possible that our observations can possess that
quality of numerical veracity which is requisite to
render them the foundation of laws, whose distinguishing
perfection consists in their strict mathematical
expression? To this the reply is twofold.
1st, that though we admit the necessary existence
of numerical error in every observation, we can
always assign a limit which such error cannot possibly
exceed; and the extent of this <em>latitude of error
of observation</em> is less in proportion to the perfection
of the instrumental means we possess, and the care
bestowed on their employment. In the greater part
of modern measurements it is, in point of fact, extremely
minute, and may be still further diminished,
almost to any required extent, by repeating the
measurements a great number of times, and under a
great variety of circumstances, and taking a mean
of the results, when errors of opposite kinds will, at
length, compensate each other. But, 2dly, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
exists a much more fundamental reply to this objection.
In reasoning upon our observations, the
existence and possible amount of quantitative error
is always to be allowed for; and the extent to which
theories may be affected by it is never to be lost
sight of. In reasoning upwards, from observations
confessedly imperfect to general laws, we must
take care always to regard our conclusions as conditional,
so far as they may be affected by such
unavoidable imperfections; and when at length we
shall have arrived at our highest point, and attained
to axioms which admit of general and deductive
reasoning, the question, whether they <em>are</em> vitiated
by the errors of observation or not, will still remain
to be decided, and must become the object of subsequent
verification. This point will be made the
subject of more distinct consideration hereafter,
when we come to speak of the verification of theories
and the laws of probability.</p>

<p>(125.) With respect to our record of observations,
it should be not only circumstantial but <em>faithful</em>; by
which we mean, that it should contain all we did
<em>observe</em>, and nothing else. Without any intention of
falsifying our record, we may do so unperceived by
ourselves, owing to a mixture of the views and language
of an erroneous theory with that of simple fact.
Thus, for example, if, in describing the effect of
lightning, we should say, “The thunderbolt struck
with violence against the side of the house, and beat
in the wall,” a fact would be stated which we did
not see, and would lead our hearers to believe that a
solid or ponderable projectile was concerned. The
“strong smell of sulphur,” which is sometimes said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
to accompany lightning, is a remnant of the theory
which made thunder and lightning the explosion of
a kind of aërial gunpowder, composed of sulphureous
and nitrous exhalations. There are some subjects
particularly infested with this mixture of theory in
the statement of observed fact. The older chemistry
was so overborne by this mischief, as quite
to confound and nullify the descriptions of innumerable
curious and laborious experiments. And in
geology, till a very recent period, it was often extremely
difficult, from this circumstance, to know
what <em>were</em> the facts observed. Thus, Faujas de St.
Fond, in his work on the volcanoes of central
France, describes with every appearance of minute
precision craters existing no where but in his own
imagination. There is no greater fault (direct falsification
of fact excepted) which can be committed
by an observer.</p>

<p>(126.) When particular branches of science have
acquired that degree of consistency and generality,
which admits of an abstract statement of laws, and
legitimate deductive reasoning, the principle of the
division of labour tends to separate the province of
the observer from that of the theorist. There is no
accounting for the difference of minds or inclinations,
which leads one man to observe with interest
the developements of phenomena, another to
speculate on their causes; but were it not for this
happy disagreement, it may be doubted whether the
higher sciences could ever have attained even their
present degree of perfection. As laws acquire generality,
the influence of individual observations becomes
less, and a higher and higher degree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
refinement in their performance, as well as a great
multiplication in their number, becomes necessary
to give them importance. In astronomy, for instance,
the superior departments of theory are completely
disjoined from the routine of practical observation.</p>

<p>(127.) To make a perfect observer, however, either
in astronomy or in any other department of science,
an extensive acquaintance is requisite, not only
with the particular science to which his observations
relate, but with every branch of knowledge which
may enable him to appretiate and neutralize the
effect of extraneous disturbing causes. Thus furnished,
he will be prepared to seize on any of those
minute indications, which (such is the subtlety of
nature) often connect phenomena which seem quite
remote from each other. He will have his eyes as
it were opened, that they may be struck at once with
any occurrence which, according to received theories,
ought not to happen; for these are the facts which
serve as clews to new discoveries. The deviation
of the magnetic needle, by the influence of an
electrified wire, must have happened a thousand
times to a perceptible amount, under the eyes of
persons engaged in galvanic experiments, with philosophical
apparatus of all kinds standing around them;
but it required the eye of a philosopher such as
Oërsted to seize the indication, refer it to its origin,
and thereby connect two great branches of science.
The grand discovery of Malus of the polarization
of light by reflection originated in his casual remark
of the disappearance of one of the images of a
window in the Luxembourg palace, one evening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
when strongly illuminated by the setting sun, viewed
through a doubly refracting prism.</p>

<p>(128.) To avail ourselves as far as possible of the
advantages which a division of labour may afford
for the collection of facts, by the industry and activity
which the general diffusion of information, in
the present age, brings into exercise, is an object of
great importance. There is scarcely any well-informed
person, who, if he has but the will, has
not also the power to add something essential to
the general stock of knowledge, if he will only
observe regularly and methodically some particular
class of facts which may most excite his attention,
or which his situation may best enable him to study
with effect. To instance one or two subjects,
which can only be effectually improved by the
united observations of great numbers widely dispersed:—Meteorology,
one of the most complicated
but important branches of science, is at
the same time one in which any person who will
attend to plain rules, and bestow the necessary
degree of attention, may do effectual service.
What benefits has not Geology reaped from the
activity of industrious individuals, who, setting aside
all theoretical views, have been content to exercise
the useful and highly entertaining occupation of
collecting specimens from the countries which they
visit? In short, there is no branch of science whatever
in which, at least, if useful and sensible
queries were distinctly proposed, an immense mass
of valuable information might not be collected from
those who, in their various lines of life, at home or
abroad, stationary or in travel, would gladly avail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
themselves of opportunities of being useful. Nothing
would tend better to attain this end than the
circulation of printed skeleton forms, on various subjects,
which should be so formed as, 1st, to ask distinct
and pertinent questions, admitting of short and
definite answers; 2dly, To call for exact numerical
statement on all principal points; 3dly, To point
out the attendant circumstances most likely to prove
influential, and which ought to be observed; 4thly,
To call for their transmission to a common centre.</p>

<p class="center b2">OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF NATURAL OBJECTS AND

<p class="in0">(129.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> number and variety of objects and relations
which the observation of nature brings before
us are so great as to distract the attention, unless
assisted and methodized by such judicious distribution
of them in classes as shall limit our view to
a few at a time, or to groups so bound together by
general resemblances that, for the immediate purpose
for which we consider them, they may be
regarded as individuals. Before we can enter into
any thing which deserves to be called a general and
systematic view of nature, it is necessary that we
should possess an enumeration, if not complete,
at least of considerable extent, of her materials
and combinations; and that those which appear
in any degree important should be distinguished
by names which may not only tend to fix them
in our recollection, but may constitute, as it were,
nuclei or centres, about which information may
collect into masses. The imposition of a name on
any subject of contemplation, be it a material object,
a phenomenon of nature, or a group of facts and relations,
looked upon in a peculiar point of view, is an
epoch in its history of great importance. It not only
enables us readily to refer to it in conversation or
writing, without circumlocution, but, what is of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
more consequence, it gives it a recognized existence
in our own minds, as a matter for separate
and peculiar consideration; places it on a list for
examination; and renders it a head or title, under
which information of various descriptions may be
arranged; and, in consequence, fits it to perform the
office of a connecting link between all the subjects
to which such information may refer.</p>

<p>(130.) For these purposes, however, a temporary
or provisional name, or one adapted for common
parlance, may suffice. But when a very great multitude
of objects come to be referred to one class,
especially of such as do not offer very obvious
and remarkable distinctions, a more systematic
and regular nomenclature becomes necessary, in
which the names shall recall the differences as well
as the resemblances between the individuals of a
class, and in which the direct relation between the
name and the object shall materially assist the solution
of the problem, “<em>given the one, to determine
the other</em>.” How necessary this may become, will
be at once seen, when we consider the immense
number of individual objects, or rather species,
presented by almost every branch of science of any
extent; which absolutely require to be distinguished
by names. Thus, the botanist is conversant with from
80,000 to 100,000 species of plants; the entomologist
with, perhaps, as many, of insects: the chemist
has to register the properties of combinations, by
twos, threes, fours, and upwards, in various doses
of upwards of fifty different elements, all distinguished
from each other by essential differences;
and of which though a great many thousands are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
known, by far the greater part have never yet been
formed, although hundreds of new ones are coming
to light, in perpetual succession, as the science advances;
all of which are to be named as they
arise. The objects of astronomy are, literally, as
numerous as the stars of heaven; and although not
more than one or two thousand require to be expressed
by distinct names, yet the number, respecting
which particular information is required, is not
less than a hundred times that amount; and all these
must be registered in lists, (so as to be at once referred
to, and so that none shall escape,) if not by
actual names, at least by some equivalent means.</p>

<p>(131.) Nomenclature, then, is, in itself, undoubtedly
an important part of science, as it prevents our
being lost in a wilderness of particulars, and involved
in inextricable confusion. Happily, in those great
branches of science where the objects of classification
are most numerous, and the necessity for a
clear and convenient nomenclature most pressing,
no very great difficulty in its establishment is felt.
The very multitude of the objects themselves
affords the power of grouping them in subordinate
classes, sufficiently well defined to admit of names,
and these again into others, whose names may become
attached to, or compounded with, the former,
till at length the particular species is identified.
The facility with which the botanist, the entomologist,
or the chemist, refers by name to any individual
object in his science shows what may be accomplished
in this way when characters are themselves
distinct. In other branches, however, considerable
difficulty is experienced. This arises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
mostly where the species to be distinguished are
separated from each other chiefly by difference in
degree, of certain qualities common to all, and
where the degrees shade into each other insensibly.
Perhaps such subjects can hardly be considered
ripe for systematic nomenclature; and that the attempt
to apply it ought only to be partial, embracing
such groups and parcels of individuals as agree
in characters evidently natural and generic, and
leaving the remainder under trivial or provisional
denominations, till they shall be better known, and
capable of being scientifically grouped.</p>

<p>(132.) Indeed, nomenclature, in a systematic point
of view, is as much, perhaps more, a consequence
than a cause of extended knowledge. Any one
may give an arbitrary name to a thing, merely to
be able to talk of it; but, to give a name which
shall at once refer it to a place in a system, we
must know its properties; and we must <em>have</em> a
system, large enough, and regular enough, to receive
it in a place which belongs to it, and to no other.
It appears, therefore, doubtful whether it is desirable,
for the essential purposes of science, that
extreme refinement in systematic nomenclature
should be insisted on. Were science perfect, indeed,
systems of classification might be agreed
on, which should assign to every object in nature
a place in some class, to which it more remarkably
and pre-eminently belonged than to any other, and
under which it might acquire a name, never afterwards
subject to change. But, so long as this is not
the case, and new relations are daily discovered,
we must be very cautious how we insist strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
on the establishment and extension of classes
which have in them any thing artificial, as a basis
of a rigid nomenclature; and especially how we
mistake the means for the end, and sacrifice convenience
and distinctness to a rage for arrangement.
Every nomenclature dependent on artificial classifications
is necessarily subject to fluctuations; and
hardly any thing can counterbalance the evil of
disturbing well-established names, which have once
acquired a general circulation. In nature, one and
the same object makes a part of an infinite number
of different systems,—an individual in an infinite
number of groups, some of greater, some of less
importance, according to the different points of view
in which they may be considered. Hence, as many
different systems of nomenclature may be imagined
as there can be discovered different heads of
classification, while yet it is highly desirable that
each object should be universally spoken of under
one name, <em>if possible</em>. Consequently, in all subjects
where comprehensive heads of classification do not
prominently offer themselves, all nomenclature must
be a balance of difficulties, and a good, short, <em>unmeaning</em>
name, which has once obtained a footing in
usage, is preferable to almost any other.</p>

<p>(133.) There is no science in which the evils resulting
from a rage for nomenclature have been felt
to such an extent as in mineralogy. The number
of simple minerals actually recognised by mineralogists
does not exceed a few hundreds, yet there
is scarcely one which has not four or five names
in different books. The consequence is most unhappy.
No name is suffered to endure long enough<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
to take root; and every new writer on this interesting
science begins, as a matter of course, by
making a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">tabula rasa</i> of all former nomenclature,
and proposing a new one in its place. The climax
has at length been put to this most inconvenient
and bewildering state of things by the appearance
of a system supported by extraordinary merit in
other respects, and therefore carrying the highest
authority, in which names which had acquired
universal circulation, and had hitherto maintained
their ground in the midst of the general confusion,
and even worked their way into common language,
as denotive of <em>species</em> too definite to admit of mistake,
are actually rendered <em>generic</em>, and extended to
whole groups, comprising objects agreeing in nothing
but the arbitrary heads of a classification from which
the most important natural relations are professedly
and purposely rejected.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>(134.) The classifications by which science is advanced,
however, are widely different from those
which serve as bases for artificial systems of nomenclature.
They cross and intersect one another, as it
were, in every possible way, and have for their very
aim to interweave all the objects of nature in a close
and compact web of mutual relations and dependence.
As soon, then, as any resemblance or analogy, any
point of agreement whatever, is perceived between
any two or more things,—be they what they will,
whether objects, or phenomena, or laws,—they immediately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ipso facto</i> constitute themselves into
a group or class, which may become enlarged to any
extent by the accession of such new objects, phenomena,
or laws, agreeing in the same point, as may
come to be subsequently ascertained. It is thus that
the materials of the world become grouped in natural
families, such as chemistry furnishes examples of,
in its various groups of acids, alkalies, sulphurets, &amp;c.;
or botany, in its euphorbiaceæ, umbelliferæ, &amp;c.
It is thus, too, that phenomena assume their places
under general points of resemblance; as, in optics,
those which refer themselves to the class of periodic
colours, double refraction, &amp;c.; and that resemblances
themselves become traced, which it is the
business of induction to generalize and include in
abstract propositions.</p>

<p>(135.) But every class formed on a positive resemblance
of characters, or on a distinct analogy, draws
with it the consideration of a negative class, in which
that resemblance either does not subsist at all, or the
contrary takes place; and again, there are classes in
which a given quality is possessed by the different
individuals in a descending scale of intensity.
Now, it is of consequence to distinguish between
cases in which there is a real opposition of quality,
or a mere diminution of intensity, in some quality
susceptible of degrees, till it becomes imperceptible.
For example, between transparency and
opacity there would at first sight appear a direct
opposition; but, on nearer consideration, when we
consider the gradations by which transparency diminishes
in natural substances, we shall see reason
to admit that the latter quality, instead of being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
<em>opposite</em> of the former, is only its <em>extreme lowest
degree</em>. Again, in the arrangement of natural objects
under the head of weight or specific gravity, the
scale extends through all nature, and we know of no
natural body in which the opposite of gravity, or
positive <em>levity</em>, subsists. On the other hand, the
opposite electricities; the north and south magnetic
polarities; the alkaline and acid qualities of
chemical agents; the positive and negative rotations
impressed by plates of rock crystal on the planes of
polarization of the rays of light, and many other
cases, exemplify not merely a negation, but an active
opposition of quality. Both these modes of classification
have their peculiar importance in the inductive
process: the one, as affording an opportunity of
tracing a relation between phenomena by the observation
of a correspondence in their scales of intensity;
the other, by that of contrast, as we shall show more
at large in the next section.</p>

<p>(136.) There is a very wide distinction, too, to be
taken between such classes as turn upon a single
head of resemblance among individuals otherwise
very different, and such as bind together in natural
groups, by a great variety of analogies, objects
which yet differ in many remarkable particulars.
For example: if we make colourless transparency
a head of classification, the list of the class will
comprise objects differing most widely in their
nature, such as water, air, diamond, spirit of wine,
glass, &amp;c. On the other hand, the chemical families
of alkalies, metals, &amp;c. are instances of groups of
the other kind; which, with properties in many
respects different, still agree in a general resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of several others, which at once decides
us in considering them as having a natural relation.
In the former cases, our ingenuity is exercised to determine
what can be the cause of their resemblance,
in the latter, of their difference; the former belong
to the province of inductive generalization, and
afford the most instructive cases for the investigation
of causes; the latter appertain to the more
secret recesses of nature; the very existence of such
families being in itself one of the great and complicated
phenomena of the universe, which we cannot
hope to unriddle without an intimate and extensive
acquaintance with the highest laws.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p class="center b2">OF THE FIRST STAGE OF INDUCTION.—THE DISCOVERY
OF PROXIMATE CAUSES, AND LAWS OF THE LOWEST
DEGREE OF GENERALITY, AND THEIR VERIFICATION.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">(137.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> first thing that a philosophic mind
considers, when any new phenomenon presents
itself, is its <em>explanation</em>, or reference to an immediate
producing cause. If that cannot be ascertained,
the next is to <em>generalize</em> the phenomenon,
and include it, with others analogous to it, in the
expression of some law, in the hope that its consideration,
in a more advanced state of knowledge,
may lead to the discovery of an adequate proximate
cause.</p>

<p>(138.) Experience having shown us the manner
in which one phenomenon depends on another in a
great variety of cases, we find ourselves provided,
as science extends, with a continually increasing
stock of such antecedent phenomena, or causes
(meaning at present merely proximate causes),
competent, under different modifications, to the
production of a great multitude of effects, besides
those which originally led to a knowledge of them.
To such causes Newton has applied the term <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">veræ
causæ</i>; that is, causes recognized as having a real existence
in nature, and not being mere hypotheses or
figments of the mind. To exemplify the distinction:—The
phenomenon of shells found in rocks, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
a great height above the sea, has been attributed
to several causes. By some it has been ascribed
to a plastic virtue in the soil; by some, to fermentation;
by some, to the influence of the celestial
bodies; by some, to the casual passage of pilgrims
with their scallops; by some, to birds feeding on
shell-fish; and by all modern geologists, with one
consent, to the life and death of real mollusca
at the bottom of the sea, and a subsequent
alteration of the relative level of the land and
sea. Of these, the plastic virtue and celestial
influence belong to the class of figments of fancy.
Casual transport by pilgrims is a real cause, and
might account for a few shells here and there
dropped on frequented passes, but is not extensive
enough for the purpose of explanation. Fermentation,
generally, is a real cause, so far as that
there <em>is such a thing</em>; but it is not a real cause
of the production of a shell in a rock, since no
such thing was ever witnessed as one of its effects,
and rocks and stones do not ferment. On the other
hand, for a shell-fish dying at the bottom of the
sea to leave his shell in the mud, where it becomes
silted over and imbedded, happens daily; and the
elevation of the bottom of the sea to become dry
land has really been witnessed so often, and on such
a scale, as to qualify it for a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i> available in
sound philosophy.</p>

<p>(139.) To take another instance, likewise drawn
from the same deservedly popular science:—The
fact of a great change in the general climate of
large tracts of the globe, if not of the whole earth,
and of a diminution of general temperature, having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
been recognised by geologists, from their examination
of the remains of animals and vegetables of
former ages enclosed in the strata, various causes
for such diminution of temperature have been assigned.
Some consider the whole globe as having
gradually cooled from absolute fusion; some regard
the immensely superior activity of former volcanoes,
and consequent more copious communication of internal
heat to the surface, in former ages, as the
cause. Neither of these can be regarded as real
causes in the sense here intended; for we do not
<em>know</em> that the globe has so cooled from fusion, nor
are we sure that such supposed greater activity of
former than of present volcanoes really did exist.
A cause, possessing the essential requisites of a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i>, has, however, been brought forward<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
in the varying influence of the distribution of land<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and sea over the surface of the globe: a change of
such distribution, in the lapse of ages, by the degradation
of the old continents, and the elevation of
new, being a demonstrated fact; and the influence
of such a change on the climates of particular regions,
if not of the whole globe, being a perfectly
fair conclusion, from what we know of continental,
insular, and oceanic climates by actual observation.
Here, then, we have, at least, a cause on which a
philosopher may consent to reason; though, whether
the changes actually going on are such as to warrant
the whole extent of the conclusion, or are even
taking place in the right direction, may be considered
as undecided till the matter has been more
thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>(140.) To this we may add another, which
has likewise the essential characters of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera
causa</i>, in the astronomical <em>fact</em> of the actual slow
diminution of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit
round the sun; and which, as a general one, affecting
the <em>mean temperature of the whole globe</em>, and
as one of which the effect is both inevitable, and
susceptible, to a certain degree, of exact estimation,
deserves consideration. It is evident that the
<em>mean</em> temperature of the whole surface of the
globe, in so far as it is maintained by the action
of the sun at a higher degree than it would have
were the sun extinguished, must depend on the
mean quantity of the sun’s rays which it receives, or,
which comes to the same thing, on the <em>total</em> quantity
received in a given invariable time: and the length
of the year being unchangeable in all the fluctuations
of the planetary system, it follows, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
total <em>annual</em> amount of solar radiation will determine,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>, the general climate of the
earth. Now, it is not difficult to show that this
amount is inversely proportional to the minor axis
of the ellipse described by the earth about the
sun, regarded as slowly variable; and that, therefore,
the major axis remaining, as we know it to be,
constant, and the orbit being actually in a state of
approach to a circle, and, consequently, the minor
axis being on the <em>increase</em>, the mean annual amount
of solar radiation received by the whole earth must
be actually on the <em>decrease</em>. We have here, therefore,
an evident real cause, of sufficient universality,
and acting <em>in the right direction</em>, to account
for the phenomenon. Its adequacy is another
consideration.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>(141.) Whenever, therefore, any phenomenon presents
itself for explanation, we naturally seek, in
the first instance, to refer it to some one or other
of those real causes which experience has shown to
exist, and to be efficacious in producing similar
phenomena. In this attempt our probability of
success will, of course, mainly depend, 1st, On the
number and variety of causes experience has placed
at our disposal; 2dly, On our habit of applying them
to the explanation of natural phenomena; and, 3dly,
On the number of analogous phenomena we can
collect, which have either been explained, or which
admit of explanation by some one or other of those
causes, and the closeness of their analogy with that
in question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
(142.) Here, then, we see the great importance
of possessing a stock of analogous instances or phenomena
which class themselves with that under
consideration, the explanation of one among which
may naturally be expected to lead to that of all
the rest. If the analogy of two phenomena be
very close and striking, while, at the same time, the
cause of one is very obvious, it becomes scarcely
possible to refuse to admit the action of an analogous
cause in the other, though not so obvious in itself.
For instance, when we see a stone whirled round in
a sling, describing a circular orbit round the hand,
keeping the string stretched, and flying away the
moment it breaks, we never hesitate to regard it as
retained in its orbit by the tension of the string,
that is, by <em>a force</em> directed to the centre; for we
feel that we do really exert such a force. We have
here <em>the direct perception</em> of the cause. When,
therefore, we see a great body like the moon circulating
round the earth and not flying off, we
cannot help believing it to be prevented from so
doing, not indeed by a material tie, but by that
which operates in the other case through the intermedium
of the string,—a <em>force</em> directed constantly
to the centre. It is thus that we are continually
acquiring a knowledge of the existence
of causes acting under circumstances of such concealment
as effectually to prevent their direct discovery.</p>

<p>(143.) In general we must observe that motion,
wherever produced or changed, invariably points
out the existence of <em>force</em> as its cause; and thus
the forces of nature become known and measured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
by the motions they produce. Thus, the <em>force</em> of
magnetism becomes known by the deviation produced
by iron in a compass needle, or by a needle
leaping up to a magnet held over it, as certainly as
by that adhesion to it, when in contact and at rest,
which requires force to break the connection; and
thus the currents produced in the surface of a quantity
of quicksilver, electrified under a conducting
fluid, have pointed out the existence and direction
of forces of enormous intensity developed by the
electric circuit, of which we should not otherwise
have had the least suspicion.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>(144.) But when the cause of a phenomenon neither
presents itself obviously on the consideration of
the phenomenon itself, nor is as it were forced on
our attention by a case of strong analogy, such as
above described, we have then no resource but in
a deliberate assemblage of all the parallel instances
we can muster; that is, to the formation of a class
of facts, having the phenomenon in question for a
head of classification; and to a search among the
individuals of this class for some other common
points of agreement, among which the cause will
of necessity be found. But if more than one cause
should appear, we must then endeavour to find, or, if
we cannot find, to <em>produce, new facts</em>, in which each of
these in succession shall be wanting, while yet they
agree in the general point in question. Here we
find the use of what Bacon terms “<em>crucial instances</em>,”
which are phenomena brought forward to decide
between two causes, each having the same analogies
in its favour. And here, too, we perceive the utility<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of <em>experiment</em> as distinguished from mere passive
observation. We make an experiment of the crucial
kind when we form combinations, and put in
action causes from which some particular one shall
be deliberately excluded, and some other purposely
admitted; and by the agreement or disagreement
of the resulting phenomena with those of the class
under examination, we decide our judgment.</p>

<p>(145.) When we would lay down general rules
for guiding and facilitating our search, among a
great mass of assembled facts, for their common
cause, we must have regard to the characters of
that relation which we intend by cause and effect.
Now, these <span class="locked">are,—</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang">

<p>1st, Invariable connection, and, in particular, invariable
antecedence of the cause and consequence
of the effect, unless prevented by some
counteracting cause. But it must be observed,
that, in a great number of natural phenomena,
the effect is produced gradually, while the cause
often goes on increasing in intensity; so that
the antecedence of the one and consequence of
the other becomes difficult to trace, though it
really exists. On the other hand, the effect
often follows the cause so instantaneously, that
the interval cannot be perceived. In consequence
of this, it is sometimes difficult to decide,
of two phenomena constantly accompanying one
another, which is cause or which effect.</p>

<p>2d, Invariable negation of the effect with absence
of the cause, unless some other cause be capable
of producing the same effect.</p>

<p>3d, Increase or diminution of the effect, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
the increased or diminished intensity of the
cause, in cases which admit of increase and diminution.</p>

<p>4th, Proportionality of the effect to its cause in
all cases of <em>direct unimpeded</em> action.</p>

<p>5th, Reversal of the effect with that of the cause.</p></blockquote>

<p>(146.) From these characters we are led to the
following observations, which may be considered as
so many propositions readily applicable to particular
cases, or rules of philosophizing: we conclude,
1st, That if in our group of facts there be one in
which any assigned peculiarity, or attendant circumstance,
is wanting or opposite, such peculiarity
cannot be the cause we seek.</p>

<p>(147.) 2d, That any circumstance in which all
the facts without exception agree, <em>may</em> be the
cause in question, or, if not, at least a collateral
effect of the same cause: if there be but one
such point of agreement, this possibility becomes a
certainty; and, on the other hand, if there be more
than one, they may be concurrent causes.</p>

<p id="p148">(148.) 3d, That we are not to deny the existence
of a cause in favour of which we have a unanimous
agreement of strong analogies, though it may not be
apparent how such a cause can produce the effect,
or even though it may be difficult to conceive its
existence under the circumstances of the case; in
such cases we should rather appeal to experience
when possible, than decide <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> against the cause,
and try whether it cannot be made apparent.</p>

<p>(149.) For instance: seeing the sun vividly luminous,
every analogy leads us to conclude it intensely
hot. How heat can produce light, we know not;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and how such a heat can be maintained, we can
form no conception. Yet we are not, therefore,
entitled to deny the inference.</p>

<p>(150.) 4th, That contrary or opposing facts are
equally instructive for the discovery of causes with
favourable ones.</p>

<p>(151.) For instance: when air is confined with
moistened iron filings in a close vessel over water,
its bulk is diminished, by a certain portion of it
being abstracted and combining with the iron, producing
<em>rust</em>. And, if the remainder be examined,
it is found that it will <em>not</em> support flame or animal
life. This contrary fact shows that the cause of the
support of flame and animal life is to be looked for
in that part of the air which the iron abstracts, and
which rusts it.</p>

<p>(152.) 5th, That causes will very frequently become
obvious, by a mere arrangement of our facts in
the order of intensity in which some peculiar quality
subsists; though not of necessity, because counteracting
or modifying causes may be at the same
time in action.</p>

<p id="p153">(153.) For example: sound consists in impulses
communicated to our ears by the air. If a series of
impulses of equal force be communicated to it at
equal intervals of time, at first in slow succession,
and by degrees more and more rapidly, we hear at
first a rattling noise, then a low murmur, and then a
hum, which by degrees acquires the character of a
musical note, rising higher and higher in acuteness, till
its pitch becomes too high for the ear to follow. And
from this correspondence between the pitch of the
note and the rapidity of succession of the impulse, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
conclude that our sensation of the different pitches
of musical notes originates in the different rapidities
with which their impulses are communicated to our
ears.</p>

<p>(154.) 6th, That such counteracting or modifying
causes may subsist unperceived, and annul the
effects of the cause we seek, in instances which,
but for their action, would have come into our class
of favourable facts; and that, therefore, exceptions
may often be made to disappear by removing or
allowing for such counteracting causes. This remark
becomes of the greatest importance, when (as is
often the case) a single striking exception stands
out, as it were, against an otherwise unanimous array
of facts in favour of a certain cause.</p>

<p>(155.) Thus, in chemistry, the <em>alkaline</em> quality of
the alkaline and earthy bases is found to be due to
the presence of oxygen combined with one or other
of a peculiar set of metals. Ammonia is, however,
a violent outstanding exception, such as here alluded
to, being a compound of azote and hydrogen: but
there are almost certain indications that this exception
is not a real one, but assumes that appearance
in consequence of some modifying cause not understood.</p>

<p>(156.) 7th, If we can either find produced by
nature, or produce designedly for ourselves, two instances
which agree <em>exactly</em> in all but one particular,
and differ in that one, its influence in producing
the phenomenon, if it have any, <em>must</em> thereby be
rendered sensible. If that particular be present
in one instance and wanting altogether in the
other, the production or non-production of the phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
will decide whether it be or be not the
only cause: still more evidently, if it be present
<em>contrariwise</em> in the two cases, and the effect be
thereby reversed. But if its total presence or
absence only produces a change in the <em>degree</em> or
intensity of the phenomenon, we can then only
conclude that it acts as a concurrent cause or
condition with some other to be sought elsewhere.
In nature, it is comparatively rare to find instances
pointedly differing in one circumstance and agreeing
in every other; but when we call experiment to
our aid, it is easy to produce them; and this is, in
fact, the grand application of <em>experiments of enquiry</em>
in physical researches. They become more valuable,
and their results clearer, in proportion as they possess
this quality (of agreeing exactly in all their
circumstances but one), since the question put to
nature becomes thereby more pointed, and its answer
more decisive.</p>

<p>(157.) 8th, If we cannot obtain a complete negative
or opposition of the circumstance whose influence
we would ascertain, we must endeavour to
find cases where it varies considerably in degree.
If <em>this</em> cannot be done, we may perhaps be able to
weaken or exalt its influence by the introduction of
some fresh circumstance, which, abstractedly considered,
seems <em>likely</em> to produce this effect, and thus
obtain indirect evidence of its influence. But then
we are always to remember, that the evidence so
obtained <em>is</em> indirect, and that the new circumstance
introduced <em>may</em> have a direct influence of its own,
or may exercise a modifying one on some <em>other</em>
circumstance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
(158.) 9th, Complicated phenomena, in which
several causes concurring, opposing, or quite independent
of each other, operate at once, so as
to produce a compound effect, may be simplified by
subducting the effect of all the known causes, as
well as the nature of the case permits, either by
deductive reasoning or by appeal to experience, and
thus leaving, as it were, a <em>residual phenomenon</em> to be
explained. It is by this process, in fact, that
science, in its present advanced state, is chiefly promoted.
Most of the phenomena which nature presents
are very complicated; and when the effects of
all known causes are estimated with exactness, and
subducted, the residual facts are constantly appearing
in the form of phenomena altogether new, and
leading to the most important conclusions.</p>

<p>(159.) For example: the return of the comet predicted
by professor Encke, a great many times in
succession, and the general good agreement of its
calculated with its observed place during any one
of its periods of visibility, would lead us to say that its
gravitation towards the sun and planets is the sole
and sufficient cause of all the phenomena of its
orbitual motion; but when the effect of this cause
is strictly calculated and subducted from the observed
motion, there is found to remain behind a
<em>residual phenomenon</em>, which would never have been
otherwise ascertained to exist, which is a small
anticipation of the time of its reappearances or a
diminution of its periodic time, which cannot be
accounted for by gravity, and whose cause is therefore
to be enquired into. Such an anticipation
would be caused by the resistance of a medium disseminated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
through the celestial regions; and as
there are other good reasons for believing this to
be a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i>, it has therefore been ascribed to
such a resistance.</p>

<p>(160.) This 9th observation is of such importance
in science, that we shall exemplify it by another
instance or two. M. Arago, having suspended
a magnetic needle by a silk thread, and set it
in vibration, observed, that it came much sooner
to a state of rest when suspended over a plate of
copper, than when no such plate was beneath
it. Now, in both cases there were two <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">veræ
causæ</i> why it <em>should</em> come at length to rest, viz. the
resistance of the air, which opposes, and at length
destroys, all motions performed in it; and the want
of perfect mobility in the silk thread. But the
effect of these causes being exactly known by the
observation made in the absence of the copper, and
being thus allowed for and subducted, a <em>residual</em>
phenomenon appeared, in the fact that a retarding
influence was exerted by the copper itself; and this
fact, once ascertained, speedily led to the knowledge
of an entirely new and unexpected class of relations.
To add one more instance. If it be true (as M.
Fourrier considers it demonstrated to be) that the
celestial regions have a temperature independent
of the sun, not greatly inferior to that at which
quicksilver congeals, and much superior to some degrees
of cold which have been artificially produced,
two causes suggest themselves: one is that assigned
by the author above mentioned; the radiation of the
stars; another may be proposed in the ether or elastic
medium mentioned in the last section, which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
phenomena of light and the resistance of comets
give us reason to believe fills all space, and which,
in analogy to all the elastic media known, may be
supposed to possess a temperature and a specific
heat of its own, which it is capable of communicating
to bodies surrounded by it. Now, if we
consider that the heat radiated by the sun follows
the same proportion as its light, and regard it as
reasonable to admit with respect to stellar heat
what holds good of solar; the effect of stellar radiation
in maintaining a temperature in space should
be as much inferior to that of the radiation of the
sun as the light of a moonless midnight is to that
of an equatorial noon; that is to say, almost inconceivably
smaller. Allowing, then, the full effect
for this cause, there would still remain a great
residuum due to the presence of the ether.</p>

<p>(161.) Many of the new elements of chemistry
have been detected in the investigation of <em>residual
phenomena</em>. Thus, Arfwedson discovered lithia by
perceiving an <em>excess of weight</em> in the sulphate produced
from a small portion of what he considered as
magnesia present in a mineral he had analysed. It
is on this principle, too, that the <em>small concentrated
residues of great operations</em> in the arts are almost sure
to be the lurking places of new chemical ingredients:
witness iodine, brome, selenium, and the new metals
accompanying platina in the experiments of Wollaston
and Tennant. It was a happy thought of
Glauber to examine what every body else threw
away.</p>

<p>(162.) Finally, we have to observe, that the detection
of a <em>possible</em> cause, by the comparison of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
assembled cases, <em>must</em> lead to one of two things:
either, 1st, The detection of a real cause, and of its
manner of acting, so as to furnish a complete explanation
of the facts; or, 2dly, The establishment
of an abstract law of nature, pointing out two phenomena
of a general kind as invariably connected;
and asserting, that where one is, there the other
will always be found. Such invariable connection
is itself a phenomenon of a higher order than any
particular fact; and when many such are discovered,
we may again proceed to classify, combine, and
examine them, with a view to the detection of <em>their</em>
causes, or the discovery of still more general laws,
and so on without end.</p>

<p>(163.) Let us now exemplify this inductive search
for a cause by one general example: suppose <em>dew</em>
were the phenomenon proposed, whose cause we
would know. In the first place, we must separate
dew from rain and the moisture of fogs, and limit the
application of the term to what is really meant,
which is, the spontaneous appearance of moisture on
substances exposed in the open air when no rain or
<em>visible</em> wet is falling. Now, here we have analogous
phenomena in the moisture which bedews a cold
metal or stone when we breathe upon it; that which
appears on a glass of water fresh from the well in hot
weather; that which appears on the <em>inside</em> of windows
when sudden rain or hail chills the external air; that
which runs down our walls when, after a long frost, a
warm moist thaw comes on: all these instances
agree in one point (Rule 2. § 147.), the coldness of
the object dewed, in comparison with the air in
contact with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
(164.) But, in the case of the night dew, is this a
<em>real cause</em>—is it a fact that the object dewed <em>is</em> colder
than the air? Certainly not, one would at first be
inclined to say; for what is to <em>make</em> it so? But the
analogies are cogent and unanimous; and, therefore,
(pursuant to Rule 3. § 148.) we are not to discard their
indications; and, besides, the experiment is easy: we
have only to lay a thermometer in contact with the
dewed substance, and hang one at a little distance
above it out of reach of its influence. The experiment
has been therefore made; the question has
been asked, and the answer has been invariably in the
<em>affirmative</em>. Whenever an object contracts dew, <em>it is</em>
colder than the air. Here, then, we have <em>an invariable
concomitant</em> circumstance: but is this chill an
effect of dew, or its cause? That dews are accompanied
with a chill is a common remark; but vulgar
prejudice would make the cold the <em>effect</em> rather
than the cause. We must, therefore, collect more
facts, or, which comes to the same thing, vary the
circumstances; since every instance in which the
circumstances differ is a fresh fact; and, especially,
we must note the contrary or negative cases (Rule
4. § 150.), <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</i> where no dew is produced.</p>

<p>(165.) Now, 1st, no dew is produced on the surface
of <em>polished metals</em>, but it is very copiously on
glass, both exposed with their faces upwards, and
in some cases the under side of a horizontal plate of
glass is also dewed; which last circumstance (by
Rule 1. § 146.) excludes the <em>fall</em> of moisture from
the sky in an invisible form, which would naturally
suggest itself as a cause. In the cases of
polished metal and polished glass, the contrast<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
shows evidently that the <em>substance</em> has much to do
with the phenomenon; therefore, let the substance
<em>alone</em> be diversified as much as possible, by exposing
polished surfaces of various kinds. This done, <em>a
scale of intensity</em> becomes obvious (Rule 5. § 152.).
Those polished substances are found to be most
strongly dewed which conduct heat worst; while
those which conduct well resist dew most effectually.
Here we encounter a <em>law</em> of the first degree of generality.
But, if we expose rough surfaces, instead of
polished, we sometimes find this law interfered with
(Rule 5. § 152.). Thus, roughened iron, especially if
painted over or blackened, becomes dewed sooner
than varnished paper: the kind of <em>surface</em> therefore
has a great influence. Expose, then, the <em>same</em> material
in very diversified states as to surface (Rule 7.
§ 156.), and another scale of intensity becomes at once
apparent; those <em>surfaces</em> which <em>part with their heat</em>
most readily by radiation are found to contract
dew most copiously: and thus we have detected
another law of the same generality with the former,
by a comparison of two classes of facts, one relating
to dew, the other to the radiation of heat from
surfaces. Again, the influence ascertained to exist
of <em>substance</em> and <em>surface</em> leads us to consider that of
<em>texture</em>: and here, again, we are presented on trial
with remarkable differences, and with a third <em>scale
of intensity</em>, pointing out substances of a close firm
texture, such as stones, metals, &amp;c. as unfavourable,
but those of a loose one, as cloth, wool, velvet,
eiderdown, cotton, &amp;c. as eminently favourable, to
the contraction of dew: and these are precisely those
which are best adapted for clothing, or for impeding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
the free passage of heat from the skin into the air,
so as to allow their outer surfaces to be very cold
while they remain warm within.</p>

<p>(166.) Lastly, among the negative instances,
(§ 150.) it is observed, that dew is never copiously
deposited in situations much screened from the open
sky, and not at all in <em>a cloudy night</em>; but if the
clouds withdraw, even for a few minutes, and leave
a clear opening, a deposition of dew presently begins,
and goes on increasing. Here, then, a cause is distinctly
pointed out by its antecedence to the effect
in question (§ 145.). A clear view of the cloudless
sky, then, is an essential condition, or, which comes
to the same thing, clouds or surrounding objects act
as <em>opposing causes</em>. This is so much the case, that
dew formed in clear intervals will often even evaporate
again when the sky becomes thickly overcast
(Rule 4. § 150.).</p>

<p id="p167">(167.) When we now come to assemble these partial
inductions so as to raise from them a general conclusion,
we consider, 1st, That all the conclusions we
have come to have a reference to that first general
fact—the cooling of the exposed surface of the body
dewed below the temperature of the air. Those
surfaces which part with their heat outwards most
readily, and have it supplied from within most
slowly, will, of course, become coldest if there be an
opportunity for their heat to escape, and not be
restored to them from without. Now, a clear sky affords
such an opportunity. It is a law well known
to those who are conversant with the nature of heat,
that heat is constantly escaping from <em>all bodies</em> in
rays, or by <em>radiation</em>, but is as constantly restored<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
to them by the similar radiation of others surrounding
them. Clouds and surrounding objects therefore
act as opposing causes by replacing the whole or a
great part of the heat so radiated away, which can
escape effectually, without being replaced, only
through openings into infinite space. Thus, at
length, we arrive at the general proximate cause of
dew, in the cooling of the dewed surface by radiation
faster than its heat can be restored to it,
by communication with the ground, or by counter-radiation;
so as to become colder than the air, and
thereby to cause a condensation of its moisture.</p>

<p>(168.) We have purposely selected this theory
of dew, first developed by the late Dr. Wells, as one
of the most beautiful specimens we can call to mind
of inductive experimental enquiry lying within a
moderate compass. It is not possible in so brief a
space to do it justice; but we earnestly recommend
his work<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> (a short and very entertaining one) for
perusal to the student of natural philosophy, as a
model with which he will do well to become familiar.</p>

<p>(169.) In the analysis above given, the formation
of dew is referred to two more general phenomena;
the radiation of heat, and the condensation of invisible
vapour by cold. The cause of the former
is a much higher enquiry, and may be said, indeed,
to be totally unknown; that of the latter actually
forms a most important branch of physical enquiry.
In such a case, when we reason upwards till we reach
an ultimate fact, we regard a phenomenon as fully explained;
as we consider the branch of a tree to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
terminate when traced to its insertion in the trunk,
or a twig to its junction with the branch; or rather,
as a rivulet retains its importance and its name till
lost in some larger tributary, or in the main river
which delivers it into the ocean. This, however, always
supposes that, on a reconsideration of the case,
we see clearly how the admission of such a fact,
with all its attendant laws, will perfectly account
for <em>every particular</em>—as well those which, in the different
stages of the induction, have led us to a knowledge
of it, as those which we had neglected, or
considered less minutely than the rest. But, had
we no previous knowledge of the radiation of heat,
this same induction would have made it known to
us, and, duly considered, might have led to the
knowledge of many of its laws.</p>

<p>(170.) In the study of nature, we must not,
therefore, be scrupulous as to <em>how</em> we reach to a
knowledge of such general facts: provided only
we verify them carefully when once detected, we
must be content to seize them wherever they are to
be found. And this brings us to consider the <em>verification</em>
of inductions.</p>

<p id="p171">(171.) If, in our induction, every individual case
has actually been present to our minds, we are sure
that it will find itself duly <em>represented</em> in our final conclusion:
but this is impossible for such cases as
were <em>unknown</em> to us, and hardly ever happens even
with all the known cases; for such is the tendency
of the human mind to speculation, that on the least
idea of an analogy between a few phenomena, it
leaps forward, as it were, to a cause or law, to the
temporary neglect of all the rest; so that, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
almost all our principal inductions must be regarded
as a series of ascents and descents, and of conclusions
from a few cases, verified by trial on many.</p>

<p>(172.) Whenever, therefore, we think we have
been led by induction to the knowledge of the proximate
cause of a phenomenon or of a law of nature, our
next business is to examine deliberately and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">seriatim</i>
all the cases we have collected of its occurrence, in
order to satisfy ourselves that they are explicable
by our cause, or fairly included in the expression
of our law: and in case any exception occurs, it must
be carefully noted and set aside for re-examination
at a more advanced period, when, possibly, the cause
of exception may appear, and the exception itself,
by allowing for the effect of that cause, be brought
over to the side of our induction; but should exceptions
prove numerous and various in their features,
our faith in the conclusion will be proportionally
shaken, and at all events its importance
lessened by the destruction of its universality.</p>

<p>(173.) In the conduct of this verification, we are to
consider whether the cause or law to which we are
conducted be one already known and recognised as
a more general one, whose nature is well understood,
and of which the phenomenon in question is but one
more case in addition to those already known, or
whether it be one less general, less known, or altogether
new. In the latter case, our verification will
suffice, if it merely shows that all the cases considered
are plainly cases in point. But in the
former, the process of verification is of a much more
severe and definite kind. We must trace the action
of our cause with distinctness and precision, as modified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
by all the circumstances of each case; we must
estimate its effects, and show that nothing unexplained
remains behind; at least, in so far as the
presence of unknown modifying causes is not concerned.</p>

<p>(174.) Now, this is precisely the sort of process in
which <em>residual phenomena</em> (such as spoken of in art.
158.) may be expected to occur. If our induction
be really a valid and a comprehensive one, <em>whatever</em>
remains unexplained in the comparison of its conclusion
with particular cases, under all their circumstances,
<em>is</em> such a phenomenon, and comes in its
turn to be a subject of inductive reasoning to discover
its cause or laws. It is thus that we may be
said to witness facts with the eyes of reason; and it
is thus that we are continually attaining a knowledge
of new phenomena and new laws which lie
beneath the surface of things, and give rise to the
creation of fresh branches of science more and
more remote from common observation.</p>

<p>(175.) Physical astronomy affords numerous and
splendid instances of this. The law, for example,
which asserts that the planets are retained in their
orbits about the sun, and satellites about their primaries,
by an attractive force, decreasing as the
square of the distances increases, comes to be verified
in each particular case by deducing from it
the exact motions which, under the circumstances,
ought to take place, and comparing them with fact.
This comparison, while it verifies in general the
existence of the law of gravitation as supposed, and
its adequacy to explain all the principal motions
of every body in the system, yet leaves some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
small deviations in those of the planets, and some
very considerable ones in that of the moon and other
satellites, still unaccounted for; residual phenomena,
which still remain to be traced up to causes. By
further examining these, their causes have at length
been ascertained, and found to consist in the mutual
actions of the planets on each other, and the disturbing
influence of the sun on the motions of the
satellites.</p>

<p>(176.) But a law of nature has not that degree of
generality which fits it for a stepping-stone to
greater inductions, unless it be <em>universal</em> in its application.
We cannot rely on its enabling us to
extend our views beyond the circle of instances
from which it was obtained, unless we have already
had experience of its power to do so; unless it
actually <em>has</em> enabled us before trial to say what will
take place in cases analogous to those originally
contemplated; unless, in short, we have studiously
placed ourselves in the situation of its antagonists,
and even perversely endeavoured to find exceptions
to it without success. It is in the precise proportion
that a law once obtained endures this
extreme severity of trial, that its value and importance
are to be estimated; and our next step in
the verification of an induction must therefore consist
in <em>extending</em> its application to cases not originally
contemplated; in studiously varying the circumstances
under which our causes act, with a view
to ascertain whether their effect is general; and in
pushing the application of our laws to extreme
cases.</p>

<p>(177.) For example, a fair induction from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
great number of facts led Galileo to conclude that
the accelerating power of gravity is the same on all
sorts of bodies, and on great and small masses indifferently;
and this he exemplified by letting bodies
of very different natures and weights fall at the
same instant from a high tower, when it was observed
that they struck the ground at the same
moment, abating a certain trifling difference, due, as
he justly believed it to be, to the greater proportional
resistance of the air to light than to heavy
bodies. The experiment could not, at that time,
be fairly tried with extremely light substances, such
as cork, feathers, cotton, &amp;c. because of the great resistance
experienced by these in their fall; no means
being then known of removing this cause of disturbance.
It was not, therefore, till after the invention
of the air-pump that this law could be put to the
severe test of an extreme case. A guinea and a
downy feather were let drop at once from the upper
part of a tall exhausted glass, and struck the bottom
at the same moment. Let any one make the
trial <em>in the air</em>, and he will perceive the force of an
<em>extreme case</em>.</p>

<p>(178.) In the verification of a law whose expression
is <em>quantitative</em>, not only must its generality be established
by the trial of it in as various circumstances
as possible, but every such trial must be one of precise
measurement. And in such cases the means
taken for subjecting it to trial ought to be so devised
as to repeat and multiply a great number of
times any deviation (if any exist); so that, let it be
ever so small, it shall at last become sensible.</p>

<p>(179.) For instance, let the law to be verified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
be, that <em>the gravity of every material body is in the
direct proportion of its mass</em>, which is only another
mode of expressing Galileo’s law above mentioned.
The time of falling from any moderate height cannot
be measured with precision enough for our purpose:
but if it can be repeated a very great multitude of
times <em>without any loss or gain</em> in the intervals, and the
whole amount of the times of fall so repeated measured
by a clock; and if at the same time the resistance
of the air can be rendered <em>exactly alike</em> for all the
bodies tried, we have here Galileo’s trial in a much
more refined state; and it is evident that almost unlimited
exactness may be obtained. Now, all this
Newton accomplished by the simple and elegant
contrivance of enclosing in a hollow pendulum the
same weights of a great number of substances the
most different that could be found in all respects, as
gold, glass, wood, water, wheat, &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>, and ascertaining
the time required for the pendulum so charged
to make a great number of oscillations; in each of
which it is clear the weights had to fall, and be
raised again successively, without loss of time,
through the same <em>identical</em> spaces. Thus any difference,
however inconsiderable, that might exist in the
time of one such fall and rise would be multiplied and
accumulated till they became sensible. And none
having been discovered by so delicate a process in
any case, the law was considered verified both in respect
of generality and exactness. This, however, is
nothing to the verifications afforded by astronomical
phenomena, where the deviations, if any, accumulate
for thousands of years instead of a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p id="p180">(180.) The surest and best characteristic of a
well-founded and extensive induction, however, is
when verifications of it spring up, as it were,
spontaneously, into notice, from quarters where
they might be least expected, or even among
instances of that very kind which were at first
considered hostile to them. Evidence of this kind
is irresistible, and compels assent with a weight
which scarcely any other possesses. To give an example:
M. Mitscherlich had announced a law to this
effect—<em>that</em> the chemical elements of which all
bodies consist are susceptible of being classified
in distinct groups, which he termed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">isomorphous</i>
groups; and <em>that</em> these groups are so related,
that when similar combinations are formed of individuals
belonging to two, three, or more of them,
such combinations will crystallize in the same geometrical
forms. To this curious and important
law there appeared a remarkable exception. According
to professor Mitscherlich, the arsenic and
phosphoric acids <em>are</em> similar combinations coming
under the meaning of his law, and their combinations
with soda and water, forming the salts
known to chemists under the names of arseniate
and phosphate of soda, ought, if the law were
general, to crystallize in identical shapes. The
fact, however, was understood to be otherwise.
But lately, Mr. Clarke, a British chemist, having
examined the two salts attentively, ascertained
the fact that their compositions deviate essentially
from that similarity which M. Mitscherlich’s law
requires; and that, therefore, the exception in
question disappears. This was something: but,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
pursuing the subject further, the same ingenious
enquirer happily succeeded in producing a <em>new</em> phosphate
of soda, differing from that generally known
in containing a different proportion of water, and
agreeing in composition exactly with the arseniate.
The crystals of this new salt, when examined,
were found by him to be precisely identical in form
with those of the arseniate: thus verifying, in a
most striking and totally unexpected manner, the
law in question, or, as it is called, the law of
isomorphism.</p>

<p>(181.) Unexpected and peculiarly striking confirmations
of inductive laws frequently occur in the
form of residual phenomena, in the course of investigations
of a widely different nature from those
which gave rise to the inductions themselves. A
very elegant example may be cited in the unexpected
confirmation of the law of the developement
of heat in elastic fluids by compression, which is
afforded by the phenomena of sound. The enquiry
into the cause of sound had led to conclusions respecting
its mode of propagation, from which its
velocity in the air could be precisely calculated.
The calculations were performed; but, when compared
with fact, though the agreement was quite
sufficient to show the general correctness of the
cause and mode of propagation assigned, <em>yet</em>
the <em>whole</em> velocity could not be shown to arise
from this theory. There was still a <em>residual</em> velocity
to be accounted for, which placed dynamical
philosophers for a long time in a great dilemma.
At length Laplace struck on the happy idea, that
this might arise from the <em>heat</em> developed in the act<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
of that condensation which necessarily takes place at
every vibration by which sound is conveyed. The
matter was subjected to exact calculation, and the
result was at once the complete explanation of the
residual phenomenon, and a striking confirmation
of the general law of the developement of heat by
compression, under circumstances beyond artificial
imitation.</p>

<p>(182.) In extending our inductions to cases not
originally contemplated, there is one step which
always strikes the mind with peculiar force, and with
such a sensation of novelty and surprise, as often
gives it a weight beyond its due philosophic value.
It is the transition from the little to the great, and
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>, but especially the former. It is so beautiful
to see, for instance, an experiment performed
in a watch-glass, or before a blowpipe, succeed, in a
great manufactory, on many tons of matter, or, in the
bosom of a volcano, upon millions of cubic fathoms
of lava, that we almost forget that these great masses
are made up of watch-glassfuls, and blowpipe-beads.
We see the enormous intervals between the
stars and planets of the heavens, which afford room
for innumerable processes to be carried on, for
light and heat to circulate, and for curious and
complicated motions to go forward among them:
we look more attentively, and we see sidereal systems,
probably not less vast and complicated than our
own, crowded apparently into a small space (from
the effect of their distance from us), and forming
groups resembling bodies of a substantial appearance,
having form and outline: yet we recoil with
incredulous surprise when we are asked <em>why</em> we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
cannot conceive the atoms of a grain of sand to be
as remote from each other (proportionally to their
sizes) as the stars of the firmament; and why
there may not be going on, in that little microcosm,
processes as complicated and wonderful as those of
the great world around us. Yet the student who
makes any progress in natural philosophy will encounter
numberless cases in which this transfer of
ideas from the one extreme of magnitude to the
other will be called for: he will find, for instance,
the phenomena of the propagation of winds referred
to the same laws which regulate the propagation
of motions through the smallest masses of air; those
of lightning assimilated to the mere communication
of an electric spark, and those of earthquakes to the
tremors of a stretched wire: in short, he must lay
his account to finding the distinction of great and
little altogether annihilated in nature: and it is well
for man that such is the case, and that the same
laws, which he can discover and verify in his own
circumscribed sphere of power, should prove available
to him when he comes to apply them on the
greatest scale; since it is thus only that he is enabled
to become an exciting cause in operations of
any considerable magnitude, and to vindicate his
importance in creation.</p>

<p>(183.) But the business of induction does not
end here: its final result must be followed out into
all its consequences, and applied to all those cases
which seem even remotely to bear upon the subject
of enquiry. Every new addition to our stock
of causes becomes a means of fresh attack with new
vantage ground upon all those unexplained parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
former phenomena which have resisted previous
efforts. It can hardly be pressed forcibly enough
on the attention of the student of nature, that there
is scarcely any natural phenomenon which can be
fully and completely explained in all its circumstances,
without a union of several, perhaps of all,
the sciences. The great phenomena of astronomy,
indeed, may be considered exceptions; but this is
merely because their scale is so vast that one only
of the most widely extending forces of nature takes
the lead, and all those agents whose sphere of action
is limited to narrower bounds, and which determine
the production of phenomena nearer at hand, are
thrown into the back ground, and become merged
and lost in comparative insignificance. But in the
more intimate phenomena which surround us it is
far otherwise. Into what a complication of different
branches of science are we not led by the consideration
of such a phenomenon as rain, for instance,
or flame, or a thousand others, which are constantly
going on before our eyes? Hence, it is hardly
possible to arrive at the knowledge of a law of
any degree of generality in any branch of science,
but it immediately furnishes us with a means of
extending our knowledge of innumerable others,
the most remote from the point we set out from;
so that, when once embarked in any physical research,
it is impossible for any one to predict where
it may ultimately lead him.</p>

<p>(184.) This remark rather belongs to the inverse
or <em>deductive</em> process, by which we pursue laws into
their remote consequences. But it is very important
to observe, that the successful process of scientific<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
enquiry demands continually the alternate use of
both the <em>inductive</em> and <em>deductive</em> method. The path
by which we rise to knowledge must be made smooth
and beaten in its lower steps, and often ascended and
descended, before we can scale our way to any eminence,
much less climb to the summit. The achievement
is too great for a single effort; stations must
be established, and communications kept open with
all below. To quit metaphor; there is nothing so
instructive, or so likely to lead to the acquisition of
general views, as this pursuit of the consequences of
a law once arrived at into every subject where it
may seem likely to have an influence. The discovery
of a new law of nature, a new ultimate fact,
or one that even temporarily puts on that appearance,
is like the discovery of a new element in chemistry.
Thus, selenium was hardly discovered by
Berzelius in the vitriol works of Fahlun, when it
presently made its appearance in the sublimates of
Stromboli, and the rare and curious products of the
Hungarian mines. And thus it is with every new
law, or general fact. It is hardly announced before
its traces are found every where, and every one is
astonished at its having so long remained concealed.
And hence it happens that unexpected lights are
shed at length over parts of science that had been
abandoned in despair, and given over to hopeless
obscurity.</p>

<p>(185.) The verification of <em>quantitative</em> laws has
been already spoken of (178.); but their importance in
physical science is so very great, inasmuch as they
alone afford a handle to strict mathematical deductive
application, that something ought to be said of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
the nature of the inductions by which they are to
be arrived at. In their simplest or least general
stages (of which alone we speak at present) they
usually express some numerical relation between
two quantities dependent on each other, either as
collateral effects of a common cause, or as the
amount of its effect under given numerical circumstances
or <em>data</em>. For example, the law of refraction
before noticed (§ 22.) expresses, by a very
simple relation, the amount of angular deviation of a
ray of light from its course, when the <em>angle</em> at which
it is inclined to the refracting surface is known,
viz. that the <em>sine</em> of the angle which the incident
ray makes with a perpendicular to the surface is
always to that of the angle made by the refracted
ray with the same perpendicular, in a constant proportion,
so long as the refracting substance is the
same. To arrive inductively at laws of this kind,
where one quantity <em>depends</em> on or <em>varies with</em> another,
all that is required is a series of careful and exact
measures in every different state of the <em>datum</em> and
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quæsitum</i>. Here, however, the mathematical form
of the law being of the highest importance, the
greatest attention must be given to the <em>extreme cases</em>
as well as to all those points where the one quantity
changes rapidly with a small change of the other.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
The results must be set down in a table in which
the <em>datum</em> gradually increases in magnitude from
the lowest to the highest limit of which it is susceptible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
It will depend then entirely on our habit
of treating mathematical subjects, how far we may
be able to include such a table in the distinct statement
of a mathematical law. The discovery of
such laws is often remarkably facilitated by the
contemplation of a class of phenomena to be noticed
further on, under the head of Collective Instances,
(see <a href="#p194">§ 194</a>.) in which the nature of the mathematical
expression in which the law sought is comprehended,
is pointed out by the figure of some
curve brought under inspection by a proper mode
of experimenting.</p>

<p>(186.) After all, unless our induction embraces
a series of cases which absolutely include the
whole scale of variation of which the quantities
in question admit, the mathematical expression so
obtained cannot be depended upon as the true one,
and if the scale actually embraced be small, the
extension of laws so derived to extreme cases will
in all probability be exceedingly fallacious. For
example, air is an elastic fluid, and as such, if
enclosed in a confined space and squeezed, its bulk
diminishes: now, from a great number of trials made
in cases where the air has been compressed into a
half, a third, &amp;c. even as far as a fiftieth of its bulk,
or less, it has been concluded that “the density of
air is proportional to the compressing force,” or the
bulk it occupies <em>inversely</em> as that force; and when
the air is rarefied by taking off part of its natural
pressure, the same is found to be the case, within
very extensive limits. Yet it is impossible that this
should be, strictly or mathematically speaking, the
true law; for, if it were so, there could be no limit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to the condensation of air, while yet we have the
strongest analogies to show that long before it had
reached any very enormous pitch the air would be
reduced into a liquid, and even, perhaps, if pressed
yet more violently, into a solid form.</p>

<p>(187.) Laws thus derived, by the direct process
of including in mathematical formulæ the results
of a greater or less number of measurements, are
called “empirical laws.” A good example of such
a law is that given by Dr. Young (Phil. Trans. 1826,)
for the decrement of life, or the law of mortality.
Empirical laws in this state are evidently <em>unverified
inductions</em>, and are to be received and reasoned on
with the utmost reserve. No confidence can ever
be placed in them beyond the limits of the data from
which they are derived; and even within those limits
they require a special and severe scrutiny to
examine <em>how nearly</em> they do represent the observed
facts; that is to say, whether, in the comparison of
their results with the observed quantities, the differences
are such as may fairly be attributed to error
of observation. When so carefully examined, they
become, however, most valuable; and frequently,
when afterwards verified theoretically by a deductive
process (as will be explained in our next chapter),
turn out to be rigorous laws of nature, and afford
the noblest and most convincing supports of which
theories themselves are susceptible. The finest
instances of this kind are the great laws of the
planetary motions deduced by Kepler, entirely from
a comparison of observations with each other, with
no assistance from theory. These laws, viz. that
the planets move in ellipses round the sun; that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
each describes about the sun’s centre equal areas in
equal times; and that in the orbits of different planets
the squares of the periodical times are proportional
to the cubes of the distances; were the results
of inconceivable labour of calculation and comparison:
but they amply repaid the labour bestowed
on them, by affording afterwards the most conclusive
and unanswerable proofs of the Newtonian system.
On the other hand, when empirical laws are unduly
relied on beyond the limits of the observations from
which they were deduced, there is no more fertile
source of fatal mistakes. The formulæ which have
been empirically deduced for the elasticity of steam
(till very recently), and those for the resistance of
fluids, and other similar subjects, have almost invariably
failed to support the theoretical structures
which have been erected on them.</p>

<p>(188.) It is a remarkable and happy fact, that
the shortest and most direct of all inductions
should be that which has led at once, or by very
few steps, to the highest of all natural laws,—we
mean those of motion and force. Nothing can
be more simple, precise, and general, than the
enunciation of these laws; and, as we have once
before observed, their application to particular facts
in the descending or deductive method is limited
by nothing but the limited extent of our mathematics.
It would seem, then, that dynamical science
were taken thenceforward out of the pale of induction,
and transformed into a matter of absolute
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> reasoning, as much as geometry; and so it
would be, were our mathematics perfect, and all the
<em>data</em> known. Unhappily, the first is so far from being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the case, that in many of the most interesting
branches of dynamical enquiry they leave us completely
at a loss. In what relates to the motions of
fluids, for instance, this is severely felt. We can
include our problems, it is true, in algebraical equations,
and we can demonstrate that they <em>contain</em>
the solutions; but the equations themselves are so
intractable, and present such insuperable difficulties,
that they often leave us quite as much in the dark
as before. But even were these difficulties overcome,
recourse to experience must still be had, to
establish the <em>data</em> on which particular applications
are to depend; and although mathematical analysis
affords very powerful means of <em>representing</em> in
general terms the data of any proposed case, and
<em>afterwards</em>, by comparison of its results with fact,
determining <em>what</em> those data must be to explain
the observed phenomena, still, in any mode of
considering the matter, an appeal to experience in
every particular instance of application is unavoidable,
even when the general principles are regarded
as sufficiently established without it. Now, in all
such cases of difficulty we must recur to our inductive
processes, and regard the branches of dynamical
science where this takes place as purely
experimental. By this we gain an immense advantage,
viz. that in all those points of them where
the abstract dynamical principles <em>do</em> afford distinct
conclusions, we obtain verifications for our inductions
of the highest and finest possible kind. When
we work our way up inductively to one of these
results, we cannot help feeling the strongest assurance
of the validity of the induction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
(189.) The necessity of this appeal to experiment
in every thing relating to the motions of fluids on
the large scale has long been felt. Newton himself,
who laid the first foundations of hydrodynamical
science (so this branch of dynamics is called), distinctly
perceived it, and set the example of laborious
and exact experiments on their resistance to motion,
and other particulars. Venturi, Bernoulli, and
many others, have applied the method of experiment
to the motions of fluids in pipes and canals; and
recently the brothers Weber have published an elaborate
and excellent experimental enquiry into the
phenomena of waves. One of the greatest and most
successful attempts, however, to bring an important,
and till then very obscure, branch of dynamical
enquiry back to the dominion of experiment, has
been made by Chladni and Savart in the case of
sound and vibratory motion in general; and it is
greatly to be wished that the example may be followed
in many others hardly less abstruse and
impracticable when theoretically treated. In such
cases the inductive and deductive methods of enquiry
may be said to go hand in hand, the one verifying
the conclusions deduced by the other; and the
combination of experiment and theory, which may
thus be brought to bear in such cases, forms an engine
of discovery infinitely more powerful than either
taken separately. This state of any department of
science is perhaps of all others the most interesting,
and that which promises the most to research.</p>

<p>(190.) It can hardly be expected that we
should terminate this division of our subject without
some mention of the “prerogatives of instances”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
of Bacon, by which he understands characteristic
phenomena, selected from the great miscellaneous
mass of facts which occur in nature, and which, by
their number, indistinctness, and complication, tend
rather to confuse than to direct the mind in its
search for causes and general heads of induction.
Phenomena so selected on account of some peculiarly
forcible way in which they strike the reason,
and impress us with a kind of sense of causation,
or a particular aptitude for generalization, he considers,
and justly, as holding a kind of prerogative
dignity, and claiming our first and especial attention
in physical enquiries.</p>

<p>(191.) We have already observed that, in forming
inductions, it will most commonly happen that
we are led to our conclusions by the especial
force of some two or three strongly impressive
facts, rather than by affording the whole mass of
cases a regular consideration; and hence the need
of cautious verification. Indeed, so strong is this
propensity of the human mind, that there is hardly
a more common thing than to find persons ready to
assign a cause for every thing they see, and, in so
doing, to join things the most incongruous, by analogies
the most fanciful. This being the case, it is
evidently of great importance that these first ready
impulses of the mind should be made on the contemplation
of the cases most likely to lead to good
inductions. The misfortune, however, is, in natural
philosophy, that the choice does not rest with us.
We must take the instances as nature presents
them. Even if we are furnished with a list of them
in tabular order, we must understand and compare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
them with each other, before we can tell which <em>are</em>
the instances thus deservedly entitled to the highest
consideration. And, after all, after much labour in
vain, and groping in the dark, accident or casual
observation will present a case which strikes us at
once with a full insight into a subject, before we
can even have time to determine to what class its
<em>prerogative</em> belongs. For example, the laws of crystallography
were obscure, and its causes still more
so, till Haüy fortunately dropped a beautiful crystal
of calcareous spar on a stone pavement, and broke
it. In piecing together the fragments, he observed
their facets not to correspond with those of the
crystal in its entire state, but to belong to another
form; and, following out the hint offered by a
“<em>glaring instance</em>” thus casually obtruded on his
notice, he discovered the beautiful laws of the
cleavage, and the primitive forms of minerals.</p>

<p>(192.) It has always appeared to us, we must
confess, that the help which the classification of instances,
under their different titles of prerogative,
affords to inductions, however just such classification
may be in itself, is yet more apparent than real.
The force of the instance must be felt in the mind,
before it can be referred to its place in the system;
and, before it can be either referred or appretiated,
it must be known; and when it <em>is</em> appretiated, we
are ready enough to interweave it in our web of induction,
without greatly troubling ourselves with
enquiring whence it derives the weight we acknowledge
it to have in our decisions. However, since
much importance is usually attached to this part of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Bacon’s work, we shall here give a few examples
to illustrate the nature of some of his principal cases.
One, of what he calls “glaring instances,” has just
been mentioned. In these, the <em>nature</em> or cause enquired
into, (which in this case is the cause of the
assumption of a peculiar external form, or the internal
<em>structure</em> of a crystal,) “stands naked and
alone, and this in an eminent manner, or in the
highest degree of its power.” No doubt, such instances
as these are highly instructive; but the
difficulty in physics is to find such, not to perceive
their force when found.</p>

<p>(193.) The contrary of glaring are “clandestine
instances,” where “the nature sought is exhibited
in its weakest and most imperfect state.” Of
this, Bacon himself has given an admirable example
in the cohesion of fluids, as a <em>clandestine
instance</em> of the “<em>nature</em> or quality of consistence,
or solidity.” Yet here, again, the same acute discrimination
which enabled Bacon to perceive the analogy
which connects fluids with solids, through the
common property of cohesive attraction, would, at
the same time, have enabled him to draw from it,
if properly supported, every consequence necessary
to forming just notions of the cohesive force; nor
does its reference to the class of clandestine instances
at all assist in bringing forward and maturing
the final results. When, however, the final
result is obtained,—when our induction is complete,
and we would verify it,—this class of instances is of
great use, being, in fact, frequently no other than
that of <em>extreme cases</em>, such as we have already spoken
of (in § 177.); which, by placing our conclusions, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
it were, in violent circumstances, try their temper,
and bring their vigour to the test.</p>

<p id="p194">(194.) Bacon’s “collective instances” (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">instantiæ
unionis</i>), are no other than general facts, or laws of
some degree of generality, and are themselves the
results of induction. But there is a species of collective
instance which Bacon does not seem to have
contemplated, of a peculiarly instructive character;
and that is, where particular cases are offered to our
observation in such numbers at once as to make the
induction of their law a matter of ocular inspection.
For example, the parabolic form assumed by a jet of
water spouted from a round hole, is a <em>collective instance</em>
of the velocities and directions of the motions
of all the particles which compose it <em>seen at once</em>,
and which thus leads us, without trouble, to recognize
the law of the motion of a projectile. Again,
the beautiful figures exhibited by sand strewed on
regular plates of glass or metal set in vibration,
are <em>collective instances</em> of an infinite number of points
which remain at rest while the remainder of the
plate vibrates; and in consequence afford us, as it
were, a sight of the law which regulates their arrangement
and sequence throughout the whole
surface. The beautifully coloured lemniscates seen
around the optic axes of crystals exposed to polarized
light afford a superb example of the same
kind, pointing at once to the general mathematical
expression of the law which regulates their production.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Of such collective instances as these, it
is easy to see the importance, and its reason. They
lead us to a general law by an induction which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
offers itself spontaneously, and thus furnish advanced
points in our enquiries; and when we start
from these, already “a thousand steps are lost.”</p>

<p id="p195">(195.) A fine example of a collective instance is
that of the system of Jupiter or Saturn with its
satellites. We have here, in miniature, and seen
at one view, a system similar to that of the planets
about the sun; of which, from the circumstance of
our being involved in it, and unfavourably situated
for seeing it otherwise than in detail, we are incapacitated
from forming a general idea but by
slow progressive efforts of reason. Accordingly, the
contemplation of the <em>circumjovial planets</em> (as they
were called) most materially assisted in securing
the admission of the Copernican system.</p>

<p>(196.) Of “Crucial instances” we have also already
spoken, as affording the readiest and securest
means of eliminating extraneous causes, and deciding
between rival hypotheses. Owing to the disposition
of the mind to form hypotheses, and to
prejudge cases, it constantly happens that, among
all the possible suppositions which may occur, two
or three principal ones occupy us, to the exclusion
of the rest; or it may be that, if we have been less
precipitate, out of a great multitude rejected for
obvious inapplicability to some one or other case,
two or three of better claims remain for decision;
and this such instances enable us to do. One of
the instances cited by Bacon in illustration of his
crucial class is very remarkable, being neither more
nor less than the proposal of a direct experiment to
determine whether the tendency of heavy bodies
downwards is a result of some peculiar mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
in themselves, or of the attraction of the earth “by
the corporeal mass thereof, as by a collection of
bodies of the same nature.” If it be so, he says,
“it will follow that the nearer all bodies approach
to the earth, the stronger and with the greater
force and velocity they will tend to it; but the
farther they are, the weaker and slower:” and his
experiment consists in comparing the effect of a
spring and a weight in keeping up the motions of
two “clocks,” regulated together, and removed alternately
to the tops of high buildings and into the
deepest mines. By <em>clocks</em> he could not have meant
pendulum clocks, which were not then known, (the
first made in England was in 1662,) <em>fly</em>-clocks,
so that the comparison, though too coarse, was not
contrary to sound mechanical principles. In short,
its principle was the comparison of the effect of a
spring with that of a weight, in producing certain
motions in certain times, on heights and in mines.
Now, this is the very same thing that has really been
done in the recent experiments of professors Airy
and Whewell in Dolcoath mine: a pendulum (a
weight moved by gravity) has been compared with
a chronometer balance, moved and regulated by a
spring. In his 37th aphorism, Bacon also speaks of
gravity as an incorporeal power, acting at a distance,
and <em>requiring time for its transmission</em>; a consideration
which occurred at a later period to Laplace,
in one of his most delicate investigations.</p>

<p>(197.) A well chosen and strongly marked crucial
instance is, sometimes, of the highest importance;
when two theories, which run parallel to each
other (as is sometimes the case) in their explanation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
of great classes of phenomena, at length
come to be placed at issue upon a single fact. A
beautiful instance of this will be cited in the next
section. We may add to the examples above given
of such instances, that of the application of chemical
tests, which are almost universally crucial experiments.</p>

<p>(198.) Bacon’s “travelling instances” are those
in which the <em>nature</em> or quality under investigation
“travels,” or varies in degree; and thus (according
to § 152.) afford an indication of a cause by
a gradation of intensity in the effect. One of his
instances is very happy, being that of “paper,
which is white when dry, but proves less so when
wet, and comes nearer to the state of transparency
upon the exclusion of the air, and admission of
water.” In reading this, and many other instances
in the Novum Organum, one would almost suppose
(had it been written) that its author had taken
them from Newton’s Optics.</p>

<p>(199.) The travelling instances, as well as what
Bacon terms “frontier instances,” are cases in which
we are enabled to trace that general law which
seems to pervade all nature—the law, as it is
termed, of continuity, and which is expressed in the
well known sentence, “Natura non agit per saltum.”
The pursuit of this law into cases where its
application is not at first sight obvious, has proved
a fertile source of physical discovery, and led us to
the knowledge of an analogy and intimate connection
of phenomena between which at first we should
never have expected to find any.</p>

<p>(200.) For example, the transparency of gold leaf,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
which permits a bluish-green light to pass through
it, is a frontier instance between the transparency
of pellucid bodies and the opacity of metals, and it
prevents a breach of the law of continuity between
transparent and opake bodies, by exhibiting a body
of the class generally regarded the most opake in
nature, as still possessed of some slight degree of
transparency. It thus proves that the quality of
opacity is not a <em>contrary</em> or <em>antagonist</em> quality to
that of transparency, but only its extreme lowest
degree.</p>

<p class="center b2">OF THE HIGHER DEGREES OF INDUCTIVE GENERALIZATION,
AND OF THE FORMATION AND VERIFICATION
OF THEORIES.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">(201.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">A</span>s</span> particular inductions and laws of the first
degree of generality are obtained from the consideration
of individual facts, so Theories result from a
consideration of these laws, and of the proximate
causes brought into view in the previous process,
regarded all together as constituting a new set of
phenomena, the creatures of reason rather than of
sense, and each representing under general language
innumerable particular facts. In raising these
higher inductions, therefore, more scope is given to
the exercise of pure reason than in slowly groping
out our first results. The mind is more disencumbered
of matter, and moves as it were in its own
element. What is now before it, it perceives more
intimately, and less through the medium of sense,
or at least not in the same manner as when actually
at work on the immediate objects of sense. But it
must not be therefore supposed that, in the formation
of theories, we are abandoned to the unrestrained
exercise of imagination, or at liberty to lay down
arbitrary principles, or assume the existence of mere
fanciful causes. The liberty of speculation which
we possess in the domains of theory is not like
the wild licence of the slave broke loose from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
fetters, but rather like that of the freeman who has
learned the lessons of self-restraint in the school of
just subordination. The ultimate objects we pursue
in the highest theories are the same as those of the
lowest inductions; and the means by which we can
most securely attain them bear a close analogy to
those which we have found successful in such inferior
cases.</p>

<p>(202.) The immediate object we propose to ourselves
in physical theories is the analysis of phenomena,
and the knowledge of the hidden processes
of nature in their production, so far as they can be
traced by us. An important part of this knowledge
consists in a discovery of the actual structure or
mechanism of the universe and its parts, through
which, and by which, those processes are executed;
and of the agents which are concerned in their
performance. Now, the mechanism of nature is
for the most part either on too large or too small a
scale to be immediately cognizable by our senses;
and her agents in like manner elude direct observation,
and become known to us only by their effects.
It is in vain therefore that we desire to become
witnesses to the processes carried on with such
means, and to be admitted into the secret recesses
and laboratories where they are effected. Microscopes
have been constructed which magnify more
than a thousand times in <em>linear</em> dimension, so that
the smallest visible grain of sand may be enlarged
to the appearance of one a thousand million times
more bulky; yet the only impression we receive by
viewing it through such a magnifier is, that it reminds
us of some vast fragment of a rock, while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
intimate structure on which depend its colour, its
hardness, and its chemical properties, remains still
concealed: we do not seem to have made even an
approach to a closer analysis of it by any such
scrutiny.</p>

<p>(203.) On the other hand, the mechanism of the
great system of which our planet forms a part
escapes immediate observation by the immensity of
its scale, nay, even by the slowness of its evolutions.
The motion of the minute hand of a watch can
hardly be perceived without the closest attention,
and that of the hour hand not at all. But what are
these, in respect of the impression of slowness they
produce in our minds, compared with a revolving
movement which takes a whole year, or twelve,
thirty, or eighty years to complete, as is the case
with the planets in their revolutions round the sun.
Yet no sooner do we come to reflect on the linear
dimensions of these orbs, (which however we do
not <em>see</em>, nor can we measure them but by a long,
circuitous, and difficult process,) than we are lost in
astonishment at the swiftness of the very motions
which before seemed so slow.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> The motion of the
sails of a windmill offers (on a small scale) an illustrative
case. At a distance the rotation seems slow
and steady—but when we stand close to one of the
sails in its sweep, we are surprised at the swiftness
with which it rushes by us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
(204.) Again, the agents employed by nature to act
on material structures are invisible, and only to be
traced by the effects they produce. Heat dilates
matter with an irresistible force; but what heat is,
remains yet a problem. A current of electricity
passing along a wire moves a magnetized needle at a
distance; but except from this effect we perceive no
difference between the condition of the wire when it
conveys and when it does not convey the stream:
and we apply the terms current, or stream, to the
electricity only because in some of its relations
it reminds us of something we have observed in a
stream of air or water. In like manner we see
that the moon circulates about the earth; and because
we believe it to be a solid mass, and have
never seen one solid substance revolve round another
within our reach to handle and examine
unless retained by a force or united by a tie, we
conclude that there <em>is</em> a force, and a mode of connection,
between the moon and the earth; though,
what that mode can be, we have no conception,
nor can imagine <em>how</em> such a force can be exerted
at a distance, and with empty space, or at most an
invisible fluid, between. (See <a href="#p148">§ 148</a>.)</p>

<p>(205.) Yet are we not to despair, since we
see regular and beautiful results brought about in
human works by means which nobody would, at
first sight, think could have any thing to do with
them. A sheet of blank paper is placed upon a
frame, and shoved forwards, and after winding its
way successively over and under half a dozen
rollers, and performing many other strange evolutions,
comes out printed on both sides. And,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
after all, the acting cause in this process is nothing
more than a few gallons of water boiled in an iron
vessel, at a distance from the scene of operations.
But <em>why</em> the water so boiled should be capable of
producing the active energy which sets the whole
apparatus in motion is, and will probably long
remain, a secret to us.</p>

<p>(206.) This, however, does not at all prevent our
having a very perfect comprehension of the whole
subsequent process. We might frequent printing-houses,
and form a theory of printing, and having
worked our way up to the point where the mechanical
action commenced (the boiler of the steam-engine),
and verified it by taking to pieces, and putting together
again, the train of wheels and the presses, and by
sound theoretical examination of all the transfers of
motion from one part to another; we should, at length,
pronounce our theory good, and declare that we
understood printing thoroughly. Nay, we might
even go away and apply the principles of mechanism
we had learned in this enquiry to other widely
different purposes; construct other machines, and
put them in motion by the same moving power,
and all without arriving at any correct idea as to
the ultimate source of the force employed. But,
if we were inclined to theorize farther, we might
do so; and it is easy to imagine how two theorists
might form very different <em>hypotheses</em> as to the origin
of the power which alternately raised and depressed
the piston-rod of the engine. One, for example, might
maintain that the boiler (whose contents we will suppose
that neither theorist has been permitted to
examine) was the den of some powerful unknown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
animal, and he would not be without plausible
analogies in the warmth, the supply of fuel and
water, the breathing noises, the smoke, and above
all, the mechanical power exerted. He would say
(not without a show of reason), that where there is
a positive and wonderful effect, and many strong
analogies, such as materials consumed, and all the
usual signs of life maintained, we are not to deny
the existence of animal life because we know no
animal that consumes such food. Nay, he might
observe with truth, that the fuel actually consists
of the chemical ingredients which constitute the
chief food of all animals, &amp;c.; while, on the other
hand, his brother theorist, who caught a glimpse
of the fire, and detected the peculiar sounds of
ebullition, might acquire a better notion of the
case, and form a theory more in consonance with
fact.</p>

<p id="p207">(207.) Now, nothing is more common in physics
than to find two, or even many, <em>theories</em> maintained
as to the origin of a natural phenomenon.
For instance, in the case of heat itself, one considers
it as a really existing material fluid, of such
exceeding subtlety as to penetrate all bodies, and
even to be capable of combining with them chemically;
while another regards it as nothing but
a rapid vibratory or rotatory motion in the ultimate
particles of the bodies heated; and produces
a singularly ingenious train of mechanical reasoning
to show, that there is nothing contradictory to
sound dynamical principles in such a doctrine.
Thus, again, with light: one considers it as consisting
in actual particles darted forth from luminous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
bodies, and acted upon in their progress by
forces of extreme intensity residing in the substances
on which they strike; another, in the vibratory
motion of the particles of luminous bodies,
communicated to a peculiar subtle and highly elastic
ethereal medium, filling all space, and conveyed
through it into our eyes, as sounds are to our ears,
by the undulations of the air.</p>

<p>(208.) Now, are we to be deterred from framing
hypotheses and constructing theories, because
we meet with such dilemmas, and find ourselves
frequently beyond our depth? Undoubtedly not.
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Est quodam prodire tenus si non datur ultra.</i>
Hypotheses, with respect to theories, are what
presumed proximate causes are with respect to
particular inductions: they afford us motives for
searching into analogies; grounds of citation to
bring before us all the cases which seem to bear
upon them, for examination. A well imagined
hypothesis, if it have been suggested by a fair
inductive consideration of general laws, can hardly
fail at least of enabling us to generalize a step
farther, and group together several such laws under
a more universal expression. But this is taking a
very limited view of the value and importance of
hypotheses: it may happen (and it has happened
in the case of the undulatory doctrine of light)
that such a weight of analogy and probability may
become accumulated on the side of an hypothesis,
that we are compelled to admit one of two things;
either that it is an actual statement of what really
passes in nature, or that the reality, whatever it be,
must run so close a parallel with it, as to admit of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
some mode of expression common to both, at least
in so far as the phenomena actually known are
concerned. Now, this is a very great step, not
only for its own sake, as leading us to a high point
in philosophical speculation, but for its applications;
because whatever conclusions we deduce from
an hypothesis so supported must have at least a
strong presumption in their favour: and we may
be thus led to the trial of many curious experiments,
and to the imagining of many useful and
important contrivances, which we should never
otherwise have thought of, and which, at all events,
if verified in practice, are real additions to our stock
of knowledge and to the arts of life.</p>

<p>(209.) In framing a theory which shall render
a rational account of any natural phenomenon, we
have <em>first</em> to consider the agents on which it depends,
or the causes to which we regard it as
ultimately referable. These agents are not to be
arbitrarily assumed; they must be such as we have
good inductive grounds to believe do exist in nature,
and do perform a part in phenomena analogous to
those we would render an account of; or such,
whose presence in the actual case can be demonstrated
by unequivocal signs. They must be <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">veræ
causæ</i>, in short, which we can not only show to exist
and to act, but the laws of whose action we can derive
independently, by direct induction, from experiments
purposely instituted; or at least make such
suppositions respecting them as shall not be contrary
to our experience, and which will remain to be
verified by the coincidence of the conclusions we
shall deduce from them, with facts. For example, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
the theory of gravitation we suppose an agent,—<i>viz.</i>
force, or mechanical power,—to act on <em>any</em> material
body which is placed in the presence of <em>any</em> other,
and to urge the two mutually towards each other.
This is a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i>; for heavy bodies (that is,
all bodies, but some more, some less,) tend to, or
endeavour to reach, the earth, and require the
exertion of force to counteract this endeavour, or
to keep them up. Now, that which opposes and
neutralizes force <em>is</em> force. And again, a plumb-line,
which, when allowed to hang freely, always hangs
perpendicularly; is found to hang observably aside
from the perpendicular when in the neighbourhood
of a considerable mountain; thereby proving that a
force is exerted upon it, which draws it towards the
mountain. Moreover, since it is a fact that the
moon does circulate about the earth, it must be
drawn towards the earth by a force; for if there
were no force acting upon it, it would go on in a
straight line without turning aside to circulate in an
orbit, and would, therefore, soon go away and be lost
in space. This force, then, which we call the <em>force</em>
of gravity, is a real cause.</p>

<p>(210.) We have next to consider the laws which
regulate the action of these our primary agents;
and these we can only arrive at in three ways: 1st, By
inductive reasoning; that is, by examining all the cases
in which we know them to be exercised, inferring,
as well as circumstances will permit, its amount or
intensity in each particular case, and then piecing
together, as it were, these <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">disjecta membra</i>, generalizing
from them, and so arriving at the laws desired;
2dly, By forming at once a bold hypothesis, particularizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
the law, and trying the truth of it by
following out its consequences and comparing them
with facts; or, 3dly, By a process partaking of
both these, and combining the advantages of both
without their defects, viz. by assuming indeed the
laws we would discover, but so generally expressed,
that they shall include an unlimited variety of
particular laws;—following out the consequences
of this assumption, by the application of such general
principles as the case admits;—comparing them
in succession with all the particular cases within our
knowledge; and, lastly, <em>on this comparison</em>, so modifying
and restricting the general enunciation of our
laws as to <em>make the results agree</em>.</p>

<p>(211.) All these three processes for the discovery
of those general elementary laws on which the
higher theories are grounded are applicable with
different advantage in different circumstances. We
might exemplify their successive application to
the case of gravitation: but as this would rather
lead into a disquisition too particular for the objects
of this discourse, and carry us too much
into the domain of technical mathematics, we shall
content ourselves with remarking, that the method
last mentioned is that which mathematicians (especially
such as have a considerable command of those
general modes of representing and reasoning on
quantity, which constitute the higher analysis,) find
the most universally applicable, and the most efficacious;
and that it is applicable with especial advantage
in cases where subordinate inductions of
the kind described in the last section have already
led to laws of a certain generality admitting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
mathematical expression. Such a case, for instance,
is the elliptic motion of a planet, which is a general
proposition including the statement of an infinite
number of particular <em>places</em>, in which the laws of its
motion allow it to be some time or other found, and
for which, of course, the law of force must be so
assumed as to account.</p>

<p>(212.) With regard to the first process of the
three above enumerated, it is in fact an induction
of the kind described in § 185.; and all the remarks
we there made on that kind of induction
apply to it in this stage. The direct assumption
of a particular hypothesis has been occasionally
practised very successfully. As examples, we may
mention Coulomb’s and Poisson’s theories of electricity
and magnetism, in both which, phenomena
of a very complicated and interesting nature
are referred to the actions of attractive and repulsive
forces, following a law similar in its expression
to the law of gravitation. But the difficulty
and labour, which, in the greater theories, always
attends the pursuit of a fundamental law into its
remote consequences, effectually precludes this method
from being commonly resorted to as a means
of discovery, unless we have some good reason,
from analogy or otherwise, for believing that the
attempt will prove successful, or have been first
led by partial inductions to particular laws which
naturally point it out for trial.</p>

<p>(213.) In this case the law assumes all the characters
of a general phenomenon resulting from an
induction of particulars, but not yet verified by comparison
with <em>all</em> the particulars, nor extended to all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
that it is capable of including. (See <a href="#p171">§ 171</a>.) It
is the verification of such inductions which constitutes
theory in its largest sense, and which
embraces an estimation of the influence of all such
circumstances as may modify the effect of the
cause whose laws of action we have arrived at and
would verify. To return to our example: particular
inductions drawn from the motions of the several
planets about the sun, and of the satellites round
their primaries, &amp;c. having led us to the general
conception of an attractive force exerted by every
particle of matter in the universe on every other
according to the law to which we attach the
name of gravitation; when we would verify this
induction, we must set out with assuming this law,
considering the whole system as subjected to its
influence and implicitly obeying it, and nothing interfering
with its action; we then, for the first time,
perceive a train of modifying circumstances which
had not occurred to us when reasoning upwards from
particulars to obtain the fundamental law; we perceive
that <em>all the planets</em> must attract <em>each other</em>,
must therefore draw each other out of the orbits
which they would have if acted on only by the sun;
and as this was never contemplated in the inductive
process, its validity becomes a question, which can
only be determined by ascertaining precisely how
great a deviation this new class of mutual actions
will produce. To do this is no easy task, or rather,
it is the most difficult task which the genius of man
has ever yet accomplished: still, it <em>has</em> been accomplished
by the mere application of the general laws
of dynamics; and the result (undoubtedly a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
beautiful and satisfactory one) is, that all those
observed deviations in the motions of our system
which stood out as exceptions (§ 154.), or were
noticed as residual phenomena and reserved for
further enquiry (§ 158.), in that imperfect view of
the subject which we got in the subordinate process
by which we rose to our general conclusion, prove
to be the immediate consequences of the above-mentioned
mutual actions. As such, they are neither
exceptions nor residual facts, but fulfilments of
general rules, and essential features in the statement
of the case, <em>without</em> which our induction would
be invalid, and the law of gravitation positively untrue.</p>

<p>(214.) In the theory of gravitation, the law is all
in all, applying itself at once to the materials, and
directly producing the result. But in many other
cases we have to consider not merely the laws which
regulate the actions of our ultimate causes, but a
system of mechanism, or a structure of parts, through
the intervention of which their effects become
sensible to us. Thus, in the delicate and curious
electro-dynamic theory of Ampere, the mutual
attraction or repulsion of two magnets is referred
to a more universal phenomenon, the mutual action
of electric currents, according to a certain fundamental
law. But, in order to bring the case of a
magnet within the range of this law, he is obliged
to make a supposition of a peculiar structure or
mechanism, which constitutes a body a magnet,
viz. that around each particle of the body there
shall be constantly circulating, in a certain stated
direction, a small current of electric fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
(215.) This, we may say, is too complex; it is
artificial, and cannot be granted: yet, if the admission
of this or any other structure tenfold more
artificial and complicated will enable any one to
present in a general point of view a great number
of particular facts,—to make them a part of one
system, and enable us to reason from the known
to the unknown, and actually to <em>predict facts before
trial</em>,—we would ask, why should it <em>not</em> be granted?
When we examine those instances of nature’s workmanship
which we can take to pieces and understand,
we find them in the highest degree artificial
in our own sense of the word. Take, for example,
the structure of an eye, or of the skeleton of an
animal,—what complexity and what artifice! In
the one, a <em>pellucid muscle</em>; a lens formed with elliptical
surfaces; a circular aperture capable of enlargement
or contraction without loss of form. In
the other, a framework of the most curious carpentry;
in which occurs not a single straight line,
nor any known geometrical curve, yet all evidently
systematic, and constructed by rules which defy our
research. Or examine a crystallized mineral, which
we can in some measure dissect, and thus obtain
direct evidence of an internal structure. Neither
artifice nor complication are here wanting; and
though it is easy to assert that these appearances
are, after all, produced by something which would
be very simple, if we did but know it, it is plain
that the same might be <em>said</em> of a steam-engine executing
the most complicated movements, previous
to any investigation of its nature, or any knowledge
of the source of its power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
(216.) In estimating, however, the value of a
theory, we are not to look, <em>in the first instance</em>,
to the question, whether it establishes satisfactorily,
or not, a particular process or mechanism; for
of this, after all, we can never obtain more than
that indirect evidence which consists in its leading
to the same results. What, in the actual state of
science, is far more important for us to know, is
whether our theory truly represent <em>all</em> the facts, and
include <em>all</em> the laws, to which observation and induction
lead. A theory which did this would, no doubt,
go a great way to establish any hypothesis of mechanism
or structure, which might form an essential
part of it: but this is very far from being
the case, except in a few limited instances; and,
till it is so, to lay any great stress on hypotheses
of the kind, except in as much as they serve
as a scaffold for the erection of general laws, is
to “quite mistake the scaffold for the pile.” Regarded
in this light, hypotheses have often an eminent
use: and a facility in framing them, if attended
with an equal facility in laying them aside when
they have served their turn, is one of the most
valuable qualities a philosopher can possess; while,
on the other hand, a bigoted adherence to them,
or indeed to peculiar views of any kind, in opposition
to the tenor of facts as they arise, is the bane
of all philosophy.</p>

<p>(217.) There is no doubt, however, that the
safest course, when it can be followed, is to rise by
inductions carried on among laws, as among facts,
from law to law, perceiving, as we go on, how laws
which we have looked upon as unconnected become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
particular cases, either one of the other,
or all of one still more general, and, at length, blend
altogether in the point of view from which we learn
to regard them. An example will illustrate what we
mean. It is a general law, that all hot bodies
throw out or <em>radiate</em> heat in all directions, (by
which we mean, not that heat is an actual substance
darted out from hot bodies, but only that
the laws of the transmission of heat to distant objects
are similar to those which would regulate the distribution
of particles thrown forth in all directions,)
and that other colder bodies placed in their neighbourhood
become hot, <em>as if</em> they received the heat
so radiated. Again, all solid bodies which become
heated in one part <em>conduct</em>, or diffuse, the heat
from that part through their whole substance.
Here we have two modes of communicating heat,—by
radiation, and by conduction; and both these
have their peculiar, and, to all appearance, very different
laws. Now, let us bring a hot and a cold
body (of the same substance) gradually nearer
and nearer together,—as they approach, the heat
will be communicated from the hot to the cold
one by the <em>laws of radiation</em>; and from the nearer
to the farther part of the colder one, as it gradually
grows warm, by <em>those of conduction</em>. Let
their distance be diminished till they just lightly
touch. How does the heat <em>now</em> pass from one to
the other? Doubtless, by radiation; for it may
be proved, that in such a contact there is yet
an interval. Let them then be <em>forced</em> together,
and it will seem clear that it must now be by
<em>conduction</em>. Yet their <em>interval</em> must diminish gradually,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
as the force by which they are pressed
together increases, till they actually cohere, and
form one. The law of continuity, then, of which
we have before spoken (§ 199.), forbids us to suppose
that the intimate nature of the process of
communication is changed in this transition from
light to violent contact, and from that to actual
union. If so, we might ask, at what point does the
change happen? Especially since it is also demonstrable,
that the particles of the most solid
body are not, really, in contact. <em>Therefore</em>, the
laws of conduction and radiation have a mutual
dependence, and the former are only extreme cases
of the latter. If, then, we would rightly understand
what passes, or what is the process of nature in
the slow communication of heat through the substance
of a solid, we must ground our enquiries
upon what takes place at a distance, and then urge
the laws to which we have arrived, up to their
extreme case.</p>

<p>(218.) When two theories run parallel to each
other, and each explains a great many facts in common
with the other, any experiment which affords a
crucial instance to decide between them, or by
which one or other must fall, is of great importance.
In thus verifying theories, since they are grounded
on general laws, we may appeal, not merely to particular
cases, but to whole classes of facts; and we
therefore have a great range among the individuals
of these for the selection of some particular effect
which ought to take place oppositely in the event
of one of the two suppositions at issue being right
and the other wrong. A curious example is given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
by M. Fresnel, as decisive, in his mind, of the question
between the two great opinions on the nature
of light, which, since the time of Newton and
Huyghens, have divided philosophers. (See <a href="#p207">§ 207</a>.)
When two very clean glasses are laid one on the
other, if they be not perfectly flat, but one or both
in an almost imperceptible degree convex or prominent,
beautiful and vivid colours will be seen between
them; and if these be viewed through a red glass,
their appearance will be that of alternate dark and
bright stripes. These stripes are formed <em>between</em> the
two surfaces in apparent contact, as any one may
satisfy himself by using, instead of a flat <em>plate</em> of
glass for the upper one, a triangular-shaped piece,
called a prism, like a three-cornered stick, and
looking through the inclined side of it next the
eye, by which arrangement the reflection of light
from the upper surface is prevented from intermixing
with that from the surfaces in contact.
Now, the coloured stripes thus produced are explicable
on both theories, and are appealed to by
both as strong confirmatory facts; but there is a
difference in one circumstance according as one or
the other theory is employed to explain them. In
the case of the Huyghenian doctrine, the intervals
between the bright stripes ought to appear <em>absolutely
black</em>; in the other, <em>half bright</em>, when so viewed
through a prism. This curious case of difference
was tried as soon as the opposing consequences of
the two theories were noted by M. Fresnel, and the
result is stated by him to be decisive in favour of
that theory which makes light to consist in the
vibrations of an elastic medium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
(219.) Theories are best arrived at by the consideration
of general laws; but most securely verified
by comparing them with particular facts, because
this serves as a verification of the whole train of
induction, from the lowest term to the highest.
But then, the comparison must be made with facts
purposely selected so as to include every variety of
case, not omitting extreme ones, and in sufficient
number to afford every reasonable probability of
detecting error. A single numerical coincidence in
a final conclusion, however striking the coincidence
or important the subject, is not sufficient. Newton’s
theory of sound, for example, leads to a numerical
expression for the actual velocity of sound, differing
but little from that afforded by the correct theory
afterwards explained by Lagrange, and (when certain
considerations not contemplated by him are
allowed for) agreeing with fact; yet this coincidence
is no verification of Newton’s view of the general
subject of sound, which is defective in an essential
point, as the great geometer last named has very
satisfactorily shown. This example is sufficient to
inspire caution in resting the verification of theories
upon any thing but a very extensive comparison with
a great mass of observed facts.</p>

<p>(220.) But, on the other hand, when a theory
will bear the test of such extensive comparison,
it matters little how it has been originally framed.
However strange and, at first sight, inadmissible its
postulates may appear, or however singular it may
seem that such postulates should have been fixed
upon,—if they only lead us, by legitimate reasonings,
to conclusions in exact accordance with numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
observations purposely made under such a variety of
circumstances as fairly to embrace the whole range
of the phenomena which the theory is intended to
account for, we cannot refuse to admit them; or
if we still hesitate to regard them as demonstrated
truths, we cannot, at least, object to receive them
as temporary substitutes for such truths, until the
latter shall become known. If they suffice to explain
all the phenomena known, it becomes highly
improbable that they will not explain more; and if
all their conclusions we have tried have proved
correct, it is probable that others yet untried will
be found so too; so that <em>in rejecting them altogether,
we should reject all the discoveries to which they may
lead</em>.</p>

<p>(221.) In all theories which profess to give a true
account of the process of nature in the production
of any class of phenomena, by referring them to
general laws, or to the action of general causes,
through a train of modifying circumstances; before
we can apply those laws, or trace the action of those
causes in any assigned case, we require to know the
circumstances: we must have data whereon to ground
their application. Now, these can be learned only
from observation; and it may seem to be arguing
in a vicious circle to have recourse to observation
for any part of those theoretical conclusions, by
whose comparison with fact the theory itself is to
be tried. The consideration of an example will
enable us to remove this difficulty. The most
general law which has yet been discovered in chemistry
is this, that all the elementary substances in
nature are susceptible of entering into combination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
with each other only in fixed or <em>definite proportions</em>
by weight, and not arbitrarily; so that when any
two substances are put together with a view to
unite them, if their weights are not in some certain
determinate proportion, a complete combination will
not take place, but some part of one or the other
ingredient will remain over and above, and uncombined.
Suppose, now, we have found a substance
having all the outward characters of a homogeneous
or unmixed body, but which, on analysis, we
discover to consist of sulphur, and lead in the
proportion of 20 parts of the former to 130 of the
latter ingredient; and we would know whether this
is to be regarded as a verification of the law of
definite proportions or an exception to it. The
question is reduced to this, whether the proportion
20 to 130 be or be not <em>that</em> fixed and definite proportion,
(or one of them, if there be more than one
proportion possible,) in which, according to the law
in question, sulphur and lead can combine; now,
this can never be decided by merely looking at the
law in all its generality. It is clear, that when particularized
by restricting its expression to sulphur
and lead, the law should state <em>what are</em> those particular
fixed proportions in which these bodies can
combine. That is to say, there must be certain data
or numbers, by which these are distinguished from
all other bodies in nature, and which require to be
known before we can apply the general law to the
particular case. To determine such data, observation
must be consulted; and if we were to have
recourse to that of the combination of the two substances
in question with each other, no doubt there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
would be ground for the logical objection of a vicious
circle: but this is not done; the determination of
these numerical data is derived from experiments
purposely made on a great variety of different
combinations, among which that under consideration
does not of necessity occur, and all these
being found, independently of each other, to agree in
giving the same results, they are therefore safely assumed
as part of the system. Thus, the law of definite
proportions, when applied to the actual state of
nature, requires two separate statements, the one
announcing the general law of combination, the
other particularizing the numbers appropriate to
the several elements of which natural bodies consist,
or the data of nature. Among these data, if
arranged in a list, there will be found opposite to the
element sulphur the number 16, and opposite to
lead, 104<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>; and since 20 is to 130 in the exact
proportion of 16 to 104, it appears that the combination
in question affords a satisfactory verification
of the law.</p>

<p>(222.) The great importance of physical data
of this description, and the advantage of having
them well determined, will be obvious, if we consider,
that a list of them, when taken in combination
with the general law, affords the means of
determining at once the exact proportion of the
ingredients of all natural compounds, if we only
know the place they hold in the system. In
chemistry, the number of admitted elements is
between fifty and sixty, and new ones are added
continually as the science advances. Now, the moment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the number corresponding to any new substance
added to the list is determined, we have,
in fact, ascertained all the proportions in which it
can enter into combination with all the others, so
that a careful experiment made with the object
of determining this number is, in fact, equivalent
to as many different experiments as there are
binary, ternary, or yet more complicated combinations
capable of existing, into which the new
substance may enter, as an ingredient.</p>

<p>(223.) The importance of obtaining exact physical
data can scarcely be too much insisted on, for
without them the most elaborate theories are little
better than mere inapplicable forms of words. It
would be of little consequence to be informed,
abstractedly, that the sun and planets attract each
other, with forces proportional to their masses,
and inversely as the squares of their distances:
but, as soon as we know the data of our system, as
soon as we have an accurate statement (no matter
how obtained) of the distances, masses, and actual
motions of the several bodies which compose it,
we need no more to enable us to predict all the
movements of its several parts, and the changes
that will happen in it for thousands of years to
come; and even to extend our views backwards
into time, and recover from the past, phenomena,
which no observation has noted, and no history
recorded, and which yet (it is possible) may have
left indelible traces of their existence in their
influence on the state of nature in our own globe,
and those of the other planets.</p>

<p>(224.) The proof, too, that our data <em>are</em> correctly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
assumed, is involved in the general verification of the
whole theory, of which, when once assumed, they
form a part; and the same comparison with observation
which enables us to decide on the truth of
the abstract principle, enables us, at the same time,
to ascertain whether we have fixed the values of our
data in accordance with the actual state of nature.
If not, it becomes an important question, whether
the assumed values can be corrected, so as to bring
the results of theory to agree with facts? Thus it
happens, that as theories approach to their perfection,
a more and more exact determination of data
becomes requisite. Deviations from observed fact,
which, in a first or approximative verification, may
be disregarded as trifling, become important when
a high degree of precision is attained. A difference
between the calculated and observed places of a
planet, which would have been disregarded by
Kepler in his verification of the law of elliptic
motion, would now be considered fatal to the theory
of gravity, unless it could be shown to arise from an
erroneous assumption of some of the numerical data
of our system.</p>

<p>(225.) The observations most appropriate for the
ready and exact determination of physical data are,
therefore, those which it is most necessary to have
performed with exactness and perseverance. Hence
it is, that their performance, in many cases, becomes
a national concern, and observatories are erected and
maintained, and expeditions despatched to distant
regions, at an expense which, to a superficial view,
would appear most disproportioned to their objects.
But it may very reasonably be asked why the direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
assistance afforded by governments to the execution
of continued series of observations adapted to this
especial end should continue to be, as it has hitherto
almost exclusively been, confined to astronomy.</p>

<p>(226.) Physical data intended to be employed
as elements of calculation in extensive theories,
require to be known with a much greater degree
of exactness than any single observation possesses,
not only on account of their dignity and importance,
as affording the means of representing an
indefinite multitude of facts; but because, in the
variety of combinations that may arise, or in the
changes that circumstances may undergo, cases
will occur when any trifling error in one of the
data may become enormously magnified in the final
result to be compared with observation. Thus, in
the case of an eclipse of the sun, when the moon
enters very obliquely upon the sun’s disc, a trifling
error in the diameter of either the sun or moon
may make a great one in the time when the eclipse
shall be announced to commence. It ought to be
remarked, that these are, of all others, the conjunctures
where observations are most available for
the determination of data; for, by the same rule
that a small change in the data will, in such cases,
produce a great one in the thing to be observed;
so, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice versâ</i>, any moderate amount of error, committed
in an observation undertaken for ascertaining
its value, can produce but a very trifling one in the
<em>reverse</em> calculation from which the data come to be
determined by observation. This remark extends
to every description of physical data in every department
of science, and is never to be overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
when the object in view is the determination of
data with the last degree of precision.</p>

<p>(227.) But how, it may be asked, are we to
ascertain <em>by</em> observation, data more precise than
observation itself? How are we to conclude the
value of that which we do not see, with greater
certainty than that of quantities which we actually
see and measure? It is the number of observations
which may be brought to bear on the determination
of data that enables us to do this. Whatever
error we may commit in a single determination,
it is highly improbable that we should always err
the same way, so that, when we come to take an
average of a great number of determinations, (unless
there be some constant cause which gives a
bias one way or the other,) we cannot fail, at
length, to obtain a very near approximation to the
truth, and, even allowing a bias, to come much
nearer to it than can fairly be expected from any
single observation, liable to be influenced by the
same bias.</p>

<p>(228.) This useful and valuable property of the
average of a great many observations, that it brings
us nearer to the truth than any single observation
can be relied on as doing, renders it the most constant
resource in all physical enquiries where accuracy
is desired. And it is surprising what a rapid
effect, in equalizing fluctuations and destroying
deviations, a moderate multiplication of individual
observations has. A better example can hardly
be taken than the average height of the quicksilver
in the common barometer, which measures the
pressure of the air, and whose fluctuations are proverbial.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Nevertheless, if we only observe it regularly
every day, and, at the end of each month,
take an average of the observed heights, we shall
find the fluctuations surprisingly diminished in
amount; and if we go on for a whole year, or
for many years in succession, the annual averages
will be found to agree with still greater exactness.
This equalizing power of averages, by destroying
all such fluctuations as are irregular or accidental,
frequently enables us to obtain evidence of fluctuations
really regular, periodic in their recurrence,
and so much smaller in their amount than the accidental
ones, that, but for this mode of proceeding,
they never would have become apparent. Thus, if
the height of the barometer be observed four times
a day, constantly, for a few months, and the
averages taken, it will be seen that a regular <em>daily</em>
fluctuation, of very small amount, takes place, the
quicksilver rising and falling twice in the four-and-twenty
hours. It is by such observations that
we are enabled to ascertain—what no single measure
(unless by a fortunate coincidence), could give
us any idea, and never any certain knowledge of—the
true <em>sea level</em> at any part of the coast, or the
height at which the water of the ocean would
stand, if perfectly undisturbed by winds, waves,
or tides: a subject of very great importance, and
upon which it would be highly desirable to possess
an extensive series of observations, at a great
many points on the coasts of the principal continents
and islands over the whole globe.</p>

<p>(229.) In all cases where there is a direct and
simple relation between the phenomenon observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and a single <em>datum</em> on which it depends, every
single observation will give a value of this quantity,
and the average of all (under certain restrictions)
will be its exact value. We say, under certain
restrictions; for, if the circumstances under which
the observations are made be not alike, they may
not all be equally favourable to exactness, and it
would be doing injustice to those most advantageous,
to class them with the rest. In such
cases as these, as well as in cases where the <em>data</em>
are numerous and complicated together, so as not
to admit of single, separate determination (a thing
of continual occurrence), we have to enter into
very nice, and often not a little intricate, considerations
respecting the <em>probable</em> accuracy of our
results, or the limits of error within which it is
<em>probable</em> they lie. In so doing we are obliged to
have recourse to a refined and curious branch
of mathematical enquiry, called the doctrine of
probabilities, the object of which (as its name
imports) is to reduce our estimation of the probability
of any conclusion to calculation, so as to
be able to give more than a mere guess at the
degree of reliance which ought to be placed in
it.</p>

<p>(230.) To give some general idea of the considerations
which such computations involve, let us
imagine a person firing with a pistol at a wafer on a
wall ten yards distant: we might, in a general way,
take it for granted, that he would hit the wall, but
not the wafer, at the first shot; but if we would form
any thing like a probable conjecture of <em>how near</em> he
would come to it, we must first have an idea of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
skill. No better way of judging could be devised than
by letting him fire a hundred shots at it, and marking
where they all struck. Suppose this done,—suppose
the wafer has been hit once or twice, that a certain
number of balls have hit the wall within an inch of
it, a certain number between one and two inches,
and so on, and that one or two have been some feet
wide of the mark. Still the question arises, what
estimate are we thence to form of his skill? how
<em>near</em> (or nearer) may we, after this experience,
safely, or at least not unfairly, bet that he will come
to the mark the next subsequent shot? This the
laws of probability enable us on such data to say.
Again, suppose, <em>before</em> we were allowed to measure
the distances, the wafer were to have been taken
away, and we were called upon, on the mere evidence
of the marks on the wall, to say where it had
been placed; it is clear that no reasoning would enable
any one to say with certainty; yet there is assuredly
one place which we may fix on with greater
probability of being right than any other. Now,
this is a very similar case to that of an observer—an
astronomer for example—who would determine
the exact place of a heavenly body. He points
to it his telescope, and obtains a series of results
disagreeing among themselves, but yet all agreeing
within certain limits, and only a comparatively small
number of them deviating considerably from the
mean of all; and from these he is called upon to
say, definitively, what he shall consider to have
been the most probable place of his star at the
moment. Just so in the calculation of physical
<em>data</em>; where no two results agree exactly, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
where all come within limits, some wide, some
close, what have we to guide us when we would
make up our minds what to conclude respecting
them? It is evident that any system of calculation
that can be shown to lead of necessity to the
most probable conclusion where certainty is not
to be had must be valuable. However, as this doctrine
is one of the most difficult and delicate among
the applications of mathematics to natural philosophy,
this slight mention of it must suffice at
present.</p>

<p>(231.) In the foregoing pages we have endeavoured
to explain the spirit of the methods to which,
since the revival of philosophy, natural science has
been indebted for the great and splendid advances
it has made. What we have all along most earnestly
desired to impress on the student is, that natural
philosophy is essentially united in all its departments,
through all which one spirit reigns and one
method of enquiry applies. It cannot, however, be
studied as a whole, without subdivision into parts;
and, in the remainder of this discourse, we shall
therefore take a summary view of the progress
which has been made in the different branches into
which it may be most advantageously so subdivided,
and endeavour to give a general idea of the nature
of each, and of its relations to the rest. In the
course of this, we shall have frequent opportunity
to point out the influence of those general principles
we have above endeavoured to explain, on the progress
of discovery. But this we shall only do as
cases arise, without entering into any regular
analysis of the history of each department with that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
view. Such an analysis would, indeed, be a most
useful and valuable work, but would far exceed our
present limits. We are not, however, without a
hope that this great desideratum in science will,
ere long, be supplied from a quarter every way
calculated to do it justice.</p>

<p class="in0">(232.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">N</span>atural History</span> may be considered in
two very different lights: either, 1st, as a collection
of facts and objects presented by nature, from the
examination, analysis, and combination of which we
acquire whatever knowledge we are capable of attaining
both of the order of nature, and of the agents she
employs for producing her ends, and from which,
therefore, all sciences arise; or, 2dly, as an assemblage
of phenomena to be explained; of effects to
be deduced from causes; and of materials prepared
to our hands, for the application of our principles to
useful purposes. Natural history, therefore, considered
in the one or the other of these points
of view, is either the beginning or the end of physical
science. As it offers to us, in a confused and
interwoven mass, the elements of all our knowledge,
our business is to disentangle, to arrange, and to
present them in a separate and distinct state: and
to this end we are called upon to resolve the important
but complicated problem,—Given the effect, or assemblage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of effects, to find the causes. The principles
on which this enquiry relies are those which constitute
the relation of cause and effect, as it exists with
reference to our minds; and their rules and mode
of application have been attempted to be sketched
out, (though in far less detail than the intrinsic
interest of the subject, both in a logical and practical
point of view, would demand,) in the foregoing
pages. It remains now to bring together, in a
summary statement, the results of the general examination
of nature, so far as it has been prosecuted
to the discovery of natural agents, and the mode in
which they act.</p>

<p>(233.) The first great agent which the analysis
of natural phenomena offers to our consideration,
more frequently and prominently than any other, is
force. Its effects are either, 1st, to counteract the
exertion of opposing force, and thereby to maintain
<em>equilibrium</em>; or, 2dly, to produce <em>motion</em> in matter.</p>

<p>(234.) Matter, or that, whatever it be, of which
all the objects in nature which manifest themselves
directly to our senses consist, presents us with two
general qualities, which at first sight appear to stand
in contradiction to each other—activity and inertness.
Its activity is proved by its power of spontaneously
setting other matter in motion, and of itself obeying
their mutual impulse, and moving under the influence
of its own and other force; inertness, in refusing to
move unless obliged to do so by a force impressed
externally, or mutually exerted between itself and
other matter, and by persisting in its state of motion
or rest unless disturbed by some external cause.
Yet in reality this contradiction is only apparent.
Force being the cause, and motion the effect produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
by it on matter, to say that matter is inert,
or has <em>inertia</em>, as it is termed, is only to say that
the cause is expended in producing its effect, and
that the same cause cannot (without renewal) produce
double or triple its own proper effect. In this
point of view, equilibrium may be conceived as a
continual production of two opposite effects, each
undoing at every instant what the other has done.</p>

<p>(235.) However, if this should appear too metaphysical,
at all events this difference of effects gives rise
to two great divisions of the science of force, which
are commonly known by the names of <span class="smcap">Statics</span>
and <span class="smcap">Dynamics</span>; the latter term, which is general,
and has been used by us before in its general sense,
being usually confined to the doctrine of motion, as
produced and modified by force. Each of these
great divisions again branches out into distinct subdivisions,
according as we consider the equilibrium
or motion of matter in the three distinct states in
which it is presented to us in nature, the solid,
liquid, and aëriform state, to which, perhaps, ought
to be added the <em>viscous</em>, as a state intermediate between
that of solidity and fluidity, the consideration
of which, though very obscure and difficult, offers a
high degree of interest on a variety of accounts.</p>

<h3><i>Statics and Dynamics.</i></h3>

<p>(236.) The principles have been definitively fixed
by Galileo and his successors, down to Newton,
on a basis of sound induction; and as they are
perfectly general, and apply to every case, they
are competent, as we have already before observed,
to the solution of every problem that can
occur in the deductive processes, by which phenomena<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
are to be explained, or effects calculated.
Hence, they include every question that can arise
respecting the motions and rest of the smallest particles
of matter, as well as of the largest masses.
But the mode of reasoning from these general principles
differs materially, whether we consider them
as applied to masses of matter of a sensible size, or
to those excessively minute, and perhaps indivisible,
molecules of which such masses are composed.
The investigations which relate to the latter subject
are extremely intricate, as they necessarily involve
the consideration of the hypotheses we may form
respecting the intimate constitution of the several
sorts of bodies above enumerated.</p>

<p>(237.) On the other hand, those which respect the
equilibrium and motions of sensible masses of matter
are happily capable of being so managed as to render
unnecessary the adoption of any particular hypothesis
of structure. Thus, in reasoning respecting the application
of forces to a solid mass, we suppose its parts
indissolubly and unalterably connected; it matters
not by what tie, provided this condition be satisfied,
that one point of it cannot be moved without setting
all the rest in motion, so that the relative situation
of the parts one among another be not changed.
This is the abstract notion of a solid which the mechanician
employs in his reasonings. And their conclusions
will apply to natural bodies, of course, only
so far as they conform to such a definition. In strictness
of speaking, however, there are no bodies which
absolutely conform to it. No substance is known
whose parts are absolutely incapable of yielding one
among another; but the amount by which they do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
yield is so excessively small as to be demonstrably
incapable, in most cases, of having any influence
on the results: and in those where it has such influence,
an especial investigation of its amount can
always be made. This gives rise to two subdivisions
of the application of mechanical reasonings to solid
masses. Those which refer to the action of forces
on flexible or elastic, and on inflexible or rigid,
bodies, comprehending under the latter all such
whose resistance to flexure or fracture is so very
great as to permit our adoption of the language and
ideas of the extreme case without fear of material
error.</p>

<p>(238.) In like manner, when we reason respecting
the action of forces on a fluid mass, all we have
occasion to assume is, that its parts are freely moveable
one among the other. If, besides this, we
choose to regard a fluid as incompressible, and
deduce conclusions on this supposition, they will
hold good only so far as there may be found such
fluids in nature. Now, in strictness, there are none
such; but, practically speaking, in the greater number
of cases their resistance to compression is so very
great that the result of the reasoning so carried on
is not sensibly vitiated; and, in the remaining cases,
the same general principles enable us to enter on a
special enquiry directed to this point: and hence the
division of fluids, in mechanical language, into compressible
and incompressible, the latter being only
the extreme or limiting case of the former.</p>

<p>(239.) As we propose here, however, only to
consider what is the actual constitution of nature,
we shall regard all bodies, as they really are, more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
or less flexible and yielding. We know for certain,
that the space which any material body appears to
occupy is not entirely filled by it; because there is
none which by the application of a sufficient force
may not be <em>compressed</em> or forced into a smaller space,
and which, either wholly, as in air or liquids, or in
part, as in the greater number of solids, will not recover
its former dimensions when the force is taken
off. In the case of air, this condensation may be
urged to almost any extent; and not only does a
mass of air so condensed completely recover its original
bulk, when the applied pressure is removed,
but if that ordinary pressure under which it exists
at the earth’s surface (and which arises from the
weight of the atmosphere) be also removed by an air-pump,
it will still further dilate itself without limit
so far as we have yet been able to try it. Hence
we are led to the conclusion that the particles of air
are mutually elastic, and have a <em>tendency to recede
from one another</em>, which can only be counteracted by
<em>force</em>, and therefore is itself a force of the repulsive
kind. Nevertheless, as air is heavy, and as gravitation
is a universal property of matter, there is no
doubt that this repulsive tendency must have a
limit, and that there is a distance to which, if the
particles of the air could be removed from each
other, their mutual repulsion would cease, and an
attraction take its place. This limit is probably
attained at some very great height above the earth’s
surface, beyond which, of course, its atmosphere
cannot extend.</p>

<p>(240.) What, however, we can only conclude by
this or similar reasoning respecting air, we see distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
in liquids. They are all, though in a small degree,
compressible, and recover their former dimensions
completely when the pressure is removed; but
they cannot be dilated (by mechanical means), and
have no tendency, while they remain liquids, to enlarge
themselves beyond a certain limit, and therefore
they assume a determinate <em>surface</em> while at
rest, and their parts actually resist further separation
with a considerable force, thus giving rise to
the phenomenon of the <em>cohesion of liquids</em>.</p>

<p>(241.) Both in air and in liquids, however, the
most perfect freedom of motion of the parts among
each other subsists, which could hardly be the case
if they were not separate and independent of each
other. And from this, combined with the foregoing
considerations, it has been concluded that they do
not actually touch, but are kept asunder at determinate
distances from each other, by the constant
action of the two forces of attraction and repulsion,
which are supposed to balance and counteract each
other at the ordinary distances of the particles, but
to prevail, the one, or the other, according as they
are forcibly urged together or pulled asunder.</p>

<p>(242.) In solids, however, the case is very different.
The mutual free motion of their parts <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter se</i> is
powerfully impeded, and in some almost destroyed.
In some, a slow and gradual change of figure may be
produced to a great extent, by pressure or blows,
as for instance in the metals, clay, butter, &amp;c.; in
others, fracture is the consequence of any attempt
to change the figure by violence beyond a certain
very small limit. In solids, then, it is evident, that
the consideration of their intimate structure has a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
very great influence in modifying the general results
of the action of such attractive and repulsive forces
as may be assumed to account for the phenomena
they present; yet the general facts that their parts
<em>cohere</em> with a certain energy, and that they resist displacement
or intrusion on the part of other bodies,
are sufficient to demonstrate at least the existence
of such forces, whatever obscurity may subsist as to
their mode of action.</p>

<p>(243.) This division of bodies into airs, liquids,
and solids, gives rise, then, to three distinct branches
of mechanical science, in each of which the general
principles of equilibrium and motion have their peculiar
mode of application; viz. pneumatics, hydrostatics,
and what might, without impropriety, be
termed stereostatics.</p>

<h3><i>Pneumatics.</i></h3>

<p>(244.) Pneumatics relates to the equilibrium or
movements of aërial fluids under all circumstances
of pressure, density, and elasticity. The weight of
the air, and its pressure on all the bodies on the
earth’s surface, were quite unknown to the ancients,
and only first perceived by Galileo, on the occasion
of a sucking-pump refusing to draw water above a
certain height. Before his time it had always been
supposed that water rose by suction in a pipe, in
consequence of a certain natural <em>abhorrence of a
vacuum</em> or empty space, which obliged the water to
enter by way of supplying the place of the air sucked
out. But if any such abhorrence existed, and had
the force of an <em>acting cause</em>, which could urge water
a single foot into a pipe, there is no reason why the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
same principle should not carry it up two, three, or
any number of feet; none why it should suddenly
stop short at a certain height, and refuse to rise
higher, however violent the suction might be, nay,
even fall back, if purposely forced up too high.</p>

<p>(245.) Galileo, however, at first contented himself
with the conclusion, that the natural abhorrence of
a vacuum was not strong enough to sustain the
water more than about thirty-two feet above its
level; and, although the true cause of the phenomenon
at length occurred to him, in the pressure of
the air on the general surface, it was not satisfactorily
demonstrated till his pupil, Torricelli, conceived the
happy idea of instituting an experiment on a small
scale by the use of a much heavier liquid, mercury,
instead of water, and, in place of sucking out the
air from above, employing the much more effectual
method of filling a long glass tube with mercury,
and inverting it into a basin of the same metal. It
was then at once seen, as by a <em>glaring instance</em>, that
the maintenance of the mercury in the tube (which
is nothing else than the common barometer) was the
effect of a perfectly definite external cause, while its
fluctuations from day to day, with the varying state
of the atmosphere, strongly corroborated the notion
of its being due to the pressure of the external air
on the surface of the mercury in the reservoir.</p>

<p>(246.) The discovery of Torricelli was, however,
at first much misconceived, and even disputed, till
the question was finally decided by appeal to a <em>crucial
instance</em>, one of the first, if not the very first
on record in physics, and for which we are indebted
to the celebrated Pascal. His acuteness perceived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
that if the weight of the incumbent air be the direct
cause of the elevation of the mercury, it must be
measured by the amount of that elevation, and therefore
that, by carrying a barometer up a high mountain,
and so ascending into the atmosphere <em>above</em> a large
portion of the incumbent air, the pressure, as well
as the length of the column sustained by it, must be
diminished; while, on the other hand, if the phenomenon
were due to the cause originally assigned, no
difference could be expected to take place, whether
the observation were made on a mountain or on the
plain. Perhaps the decisive effect of the experiment
which he caused to be instituted for the purpose, on
the Puy de Dôme, a high mountain in Auvergne,
while it convinced every one of the truth of Torricelli’s
views, tended more powerfully than any thing
which had previously been done in science to confirm,
in the minds of men, that disposition to experimental
verification which had scarcely yet taken
full and secure root.</p>

<p>(247.) Immediately on this discovery followed
that of the air-pump, by Otto von Guericke of Magdeburgh,
whose aim seems to have been to decide
the question, whether a vacuum could or could not
exist, by endeavouring to make one. The imperfection
of his mechanism enabled him only to diminish
the aërial contents of his receivers, not entirely
to empty them; but the curious effects produced by
even a partial exhaustion of air speedily excited attention,
and induced our illustrious countryman,
Robert Boyle, to the prosecution of those experiments
which terminated in his hands, and in those
of Hauksbee, Hooke, Mariotte, and others, in a satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
knowledge of the general law of the equilibrium
of the air under the influence of greater or less
pressures. These discoveries have since been extended
to all the various descriptions of aërial fluids
which chemistry has shown to exist, and to maintain
their aëriform state under artificial pressure,
and even to those which may be produced from
liquids reduced to a state of vapour by heat, so long
as they retain that state.</p>

<p>(248.) The manner in which the observed law of
equilibrium of an elastic fluid, like air, may be considered
to originate in the mutual repulsion of its
particles, has been investigated by Newton, and the
actual statement of the law itself, as announced by
Mariotte, “that the density of the air, or the quantity
of it contained in the same space, is, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cæteris
paribus</i>, proportional to the pressure it supports,” has
recently been verified within very extensive limits
by direct experiment, by a committee of the Royal
Academy of Paris. This law contains the principle
of solution of every dynamical question that can
occur relative to the equilibrium of elastic fluids,
and is therefore to be regarded as one of the highest
<em>axioms</em> in the science of pneumatics.</p>

<h3><i>Hydrostatics.</i></h3>

<p>(249.) The principles of the equilibrium of
liquids, understanding by this word such fluids as do
not, though quite at liberty, attempt to dilate themselves
beyond a certain point, are at once few and
simple. The first steps towards a knowledge of them
were made by Archimedes, who established the
general fact, that a solid immersed in a liquid loses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
a portion of its weight equal to that of the liquid it
displaces. It seems very astonishing, after this, that
it should not have been at once concluded that the
weight thus said to be <em>lost</em> is only <em>counteracted</em> by
the upward pressure of the liquid, and that, therefore,
a portion of any liquid, surrounded on all sides
by a liquid of the same kind, does really exert its
weight in keeping its place. Yet the prejudice that
“liquids do not gravitate in their natural place”
kept its ground, and was only dispelled with the
mass of error and absurdity which the introduction
of a rational and experimental philosophy by Galileo
swept away.</p>

<p>(250.) The hydrostatical law of <em>the equal pressure
of liquids in all directions</em>, with its train of
curious and important consequences, is an immediate
conclusion from the perfect mobility of their
parts among one another, in consequence of which
each of them tends to recede from an excess of
pressure on one side, and thus bears upon the rest,
and distributes the pressure among its neighbours.
In this form it was laid down by Newton, and has
proved one of the most useful and fertile principles
of physico-mathematical reasoning on the equilibrium
of fluid masses, as affording a means of
tracing the action of a force applied at any point
of a liquid through its whole extent. It applies,
too, without any modification, to expansible fluids
as well as to liquids; and, in the applications of
geometry to this subject, enables us to dispense
with any minute and intricate enquiries as to the
mode in which individual particles act on each other.</p>

<p>(251.) In a practical point of view, this law is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
remarkable for the directness of its application to
useful purposes. The immediate and perfect distribution
of a pressure applied on any one part, however
small, of a fluid surface through the whole mass, enables
us to communicate <em>at one instant</em> the same pressure
to any number of such parts by merely increasing
the surface of the fluid, which may be done by
enlarging the containing vessel; and if the vessel
be so constructed that a large portion of its surface
shall be moveable together, the pressures on all the
similar parts of this portion will be united into one
consentient force, which may thus be increased to
any extent we please. The hydraulic press, invented
by Bramah, (or rather applied by him after
a much more ancient inventor, Stevin,) is constructed
on this principle. A small quantity of
water is driven by sufficient pressure into a vessel
<em>already full</em>, and provided with a moveable surface
or piston of great size. Under such circumstances
something must give way; the great surface of the
piston accumulates the pressure on it to such an
extent that nothing can resist its violence. Thus,
trees are torn up by the roots; piles extracted from
the earth; woollen and cotton goods compressed
into the most portable dimensions; and even hay,
for military service, reduced to such a state of
coercion as to be easily packed on board transports.</p>

<p>(252.) Liquids differ from aëriform fluids by
their <em>cohesion</em>, which may be regarded as a kind
of approach to a solid state, and was so regarded
by Bacon (193.). Indeed, there can be little doubt
that the solid, liquid, and aëriform states of bodies
are merely stages in a progress of gradual transition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
from one extreme to the other; and that,
however strongly marked the distinctions between
them may appear, they will ultimately turn out to
be separated by no sudden or violent line of demarcation,
but shade into each other by insensible
gradations. The late experiments of Baron Cagnard
de la Tour may be regarded as a first step towards
the full demonstration of this (199.). But the
cohesion of liquids is not, like that of solids, so
modified by their structure in other respects as to
destroy the mobility of their parts one among another
(unless in those cases of nearer approach to
the solid state which obtain in viscid or gummy
liquids). On the contrary, the two qualities co-exist,
and give rise to a number of curious and intricate
phenomena.</p>

<p>(253.) One of the most remarkable of these is
capillary attraction, or capillarity as it is sometimes
called. Every body has remarked the adhesion of
water to glass. The elevation of the general surface
of the liquid where it is in contact with the containing
vessel; the form of a drop suspended at the
under side of a solid: these are instances of capillary
attraction. If a small glass tube with a bore
as fine as a hair be immersed in water, the water
will be observed to rise in it to a certain height,
and to assume a concave surface at its upper extremity.
The attraction of the glass on the water,
and the cohesion of the parts of the water to each
other, are no doubt the joint causes of this curious
effect; but the mode of action is at once obscure
and complex; and although the researches of Laplace
and Young have thrown great light on it, further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
investigation seems necessary before we can
be said distinctly to understand it.</p>

<p>(254.) As the capillarity and cohesion of the parts
of liquids shows them to possess the power of
mutual attraction, so their elasticity demonstrates
that they also possess that of repulsion when forcibly
brought nearer than their natural state. From
the extremely small extent to which the compression
of liquids can be carried by any force we can
employ, compared with that of air, we must conclude
that this repulsion is much more violent in
the former than in the latter, but counteracted also
by a more powerful force of attraction. So much
more powerful, indeed, is the resistance of liquids
to compression, that they were usually regarded as
incompressible; an opinion corroborated by a celebrated
experiment made at Florence, in which
water was forced through the pores (as it was said)
of a golden ball. More recent experiments by Canton,
and since by Perkins, Oërsted, and others, have
demonstrated however the contrary, and assigned
the amount of compression.</p>

<p>(255.) The consideration of the motions of fluids,
whether liquid or expansible, is infinitely more complicated
than that of their equilibrium. When their
motions are slow, it is reasonable to suppose that
the law of the equable distribution of pressure obtains;
but in very rapid displacements of their
parts one among the other, it is not easy to see how
such an equable distribution can be accomplished,
and some phenomena exist which seem to indicate
a contrary conclusion.</p>

<p>(256.) Independent of this, there are difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
of an almost insuperable nature to the regular deductive
application of the general principles of
mechanics to this subject, which arise from the
excessive intricacy of the pure mathematical enquiries
to which its investigation leads. It was
Newton who set the example of a first attempt to
draw any conclusions respecting the motion of fluid
masses by direct reasoning from dynamical principles,
and thus laid the foundation of <span class="smcap">Hydrodynamics</span>;
but it was not till the time of D’Alembert
that the method of reducing any question
respecting the motions of fluids under the action
of forces to strict mathematical investigation could
be said to be completely understood. But the cases
even now in which this mode of treating such questions
can be applied with full satisfaction are few
in comparison of those in which the experimental
method of enquiry as already observed (189.) is
preferable. Such, for example, is that of the resistance
of fluids to bodies moving through them;
a knowledge of which is of great importance in
naval architecture and in gunnery, where the resistance
of the air acts to an enormous extent.
Such, too, among the practical subjects which depend
mainly on this branch of science, are the use
of sails in navigation; the construction of windmills,
and water-wheels; the transmission of water through
pipes and channels; the construction of docks and
harbours, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><i>Nature of Solids in general.</i></h3>

<p>(257.) The intimate constitution of solids is, in all
probability, very complicated, and we cannot be said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
to know much of it. By some recent delicate experiments
on the dimensions of wires violently
strained, it has been shown that they are to a
certain small extent capable of being dilated by
tension, as they are also of being compressed by
pressure, but within limits even narrower than those
of liquids. Usually, when strained too far, they
break, and refuse to re-unite; or, if compressed too
forcibly, take a permanent contraction of dimension.
Thus, wood may be indented by a blow, and metals
rendered denser and heavier by hammering or
rolling. There is a certain degree of confusion
prevalent in ordinary language about the hardness,
elasticity, and other similar qualities, of solids, which
it may be well to remove. Hardness is that disposition
of a solid which renders it difficult to
displace its parts among themselves. Thus, steel
is harder than iron; and diamond almost infinitely
harder than any other substance in nature: but the
compressibility of steel, or the extent to which it
will yield to a given pressure and recover itself, is
not much less than that of soft iron, and that of
ice is very nearly the same with that of water.</p>

<p>(258.) Again, we call Indian rubber a very elastic
body, and so it is; but in a different sense from
steel. Its parts admit of great mutual displacement
without permanent dislocation; however distorted,
it recovers its figure readily, but with a
small force. Yet, if Indian rubber were to be enclosed
in a space that it just filled, so as not to
permit its parts to yield laterally, doubtless it would
resist actual compression with great violence. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
then, we have an instance of two kinds of elasticity
in one substance; a feebler effort of recovery
from distorted figure, and a more violent one from
a state of altered dimension. Both, however, originate
in the same causes, and are referable to the
same principles; the former being in fact only a
modified case of the latter, as the effort of a steel
spring, when bent, to recover its former shape, is
referable to the same forces which give to steel its
hardness and strength to resist actual compression
and fracture.</p>

<p>(259.) The toughness of a solid, or that quality
by which it will endure heavy blows without breaking,
is again distinct from hardness though often
confounded with it. It consists in a certain yielding
of parts with a powerful general cohesion, and is
compatible with various degrees of elasticity. Malleability
is again another quality of solids, especially
metals, quite distinct from toughness, and depends
on their capability of being deprived of their figure
without an effort to recover it and without fracture.</p>

<p>(260.) Tenacity, again, is a property of solids more
directly depending on the cohesion of their parts
than toughness. It consists in their power of resisting
separation by a strain steadily applied, while
the quality of toughness is materially influenced by
their disposition to communicate through their substance
the jarring effect of a blow. Accordingly,
the tenacity of a solid is a direct measure of the
cohesive attraction of its parts, and is the best
proof of the existence of such a power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Crystallography.</i></h3>

<p>(261.) It cannot be supposed that these and
many other tangible qualities, as they may be called,
should subsist in solids without a corresponding
mechanism in their internal structure. That they
have such a mechanism, and that a very curious and
intricate one, the phenomena of crystallography
sufficiently show. This interesting and beautiful
department of natural science is of comparatively
very modern date. That many natural substances
affected certain forms must have been known from
the earliest times. Pliny appears to have been acquainted
with this fact, at least in some instances,
as he describes the forms of quartz and diamond.
But till the time of Linnæus no material attention
seems to have been bestowed on the subject. He,
however, observed, and described with care, the
crystalline forms of a variety of substances, and even
regarded them as so definite a character of the
solids which assumed them, that he supposed every
particular form to be generated by a particular salt.
Romé de l’Isle pursued the study of the crystalline
forms of bodies yet farther. He first ascertained
the important fact of the constancy of the angles
at which their faces meet; and observing further
that many of them appear in several different shapes,
first conceived the idea that these shapes might
be reducible to one, appropriated in a peculiar
manner to each <em>substance</em>, and modified by strict
geometrical laws. Bergmann, reasoning on a fact
imparted to him by his pupil Gahn, made a yet
greater step, and showed how at least one species<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
of crystal might be built up of thin laminæ ranged
in a certain order, and following certain rules of
superposition. He failed, however, in deducing just
and general conclusions from this remark, which,
correctly viewed, is the foundation of the most important
law of crystallography, that which connects
the primitive form with other forms capable of being
exhibited by the same substance, by a certain
fixed relation. An idea may be formed of what is
meant by this sort of connection of one form with
another, by considering a pointed pyramid built
up of cubic stones, disposed in layers, each of
which separately is a square plate of the thickness
of a single stone. These layers, laid horizontally
one on the other, and decreasing regularly in size
from the bottom to the top, produce a pyramidal
form with a rough or channeled surface; and if the
layers are so extremely thin that the channels cease
to be visible to the eye, the pyramid will seem
smooth and perfect.</p>

<p>(262.) Very shortly after this, and without
knowledge of what had been done by Gahn and
Bergmann, the Abbé Haüy, instructed by the accidental
fracture of a fine group of crystals, made
the remark noticed already (in 67.), and reasoning
on it with more caution and success, and pursuing
it into all its detail, developed the general
laws which regulate the superposition of the layers
of particles of which he supposes all crystals to
be built up, and which enable us, from knowing
their primitive forms, to discover, previous to trial,
what other forms they are capable of assuming;
and which, according to this idea, are called derivative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
or secondary forms. Mohs and others have
since imagined processes and systems by which the
derivation of forms from each other is facilitated,
and have corrected some errors of over-hasty generalization
into which their predecessors had fallen,
as well as advanced, by an extraordinary diligence
of research, our knowledge of the forms which the
various substances which occur in nature and art
actually do assume.</p>

<p>(263.) In what manner a variety in point of external
form may originate in a variety of figures
in the ultimate particles of which a solid is composed,
may very readily be imagined by considering
what would happen if the bricks of which an edifice
is constructed had all a certain <em>leaning</em> or bias in
one direction out of the perpendicular. Suppose
every brick, for instance, when laid flat on its face,
with its longer edges north and south, had its eastern
and western faces upright, but its northern and
southern ones leaning southwards at a certain inclination
the same for each brick; a house built
of such bricks would lean the same way, if the
bricks fitted well together. If, <em>besides this</em>, the
eastern and western faces of the bricks, instead of
being truly upright, had an inclination eastward, the
house would have a similar one, and all its four
corners, instead of being upright, would lean to the
south-east. Suppose, instead of a house, a pyramid
were built of such oblique bricks, with the sides of
its base directed to the four points of the compass;
then its point, instead of being situated vertically
over the centre of its base, would stand perpendicularly
over some point to the south-east of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
centre, and the pyramid itself would have its sides
facing the south and the east, more highly inclined
to the horizon than those towards the north and
west.</p>

<p>(264.) Whatever conception we may form of the
manner in which the particles of a crystal cohere
and form masses, it is next to impossible to divest
ourselves of the idea of a determinate figure common
to them all. Any other supposition, indeed,
would be incompatible with that exact similarity in
all other respects which the phenomena of chemistry
may be considered as having demonstrated. However,
it must be borne in mind that this idea, plausible
as it may appear, is yet in some degree hypothetical,
and that the laws of crystallography, as
determined from inductive observation, are quite
independent of any supposition of the kind, or even
of the existence of such things as ultimate particles
or atoms at all.</p>

<p>(265.) Still, that peculiar internal constitution of
solid bodies, whatever it be, which is indicated by
the assumption of determinate figures, by their
splitting easier in some directions than in others,
and by their presenting glittering plane surfaces
when broken into fragments, cannot but have an
important influence on all their relations to external
agents, as well as to their internal movements and
the mutual actions of their parts on one another.
Accordingly, the division of bodies into crystallized
and uncrystallized, or imperfectly crystallized, is
one of the most universal importance; and almost
all the phenomena produced by those more intimate
natural causes which act within small limits, and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
it were on the immediate mechanism of solid substances,
are remarkably modified by their crystalline
structure. Thus, in transparent solids, the course
taken by the rays of light, in traversing them, as
well as the properties impressed upon them in so
doing, are intimately connected with this structure.
The recent experiments of M. Savart, too, have
proved that this is also the case with their power
of resistance to external force, on which depends
their elasticity. Crystallized substances, according
to the results of these experiments, resist compression
with different degrees of elastic force, according
to the direction in which it is attempted to compress
them; and all the phenomena dependent on their
elasticity are affected by this cause, especially those
which relate to their vibratory movements and their
conveyance of sound.</p>

<p>(266.) There can be little doubt that modifications,
similarly depending on the internal structure
of crystals, will be traced through every department
of physics. In that interesting one which
relates to the action of heat in expanding the
dimensions of substances, a beginning has already
been made by Professor Mitscherlich. It had long
been known that all substances are dilated by heat,
and no exception to this law has been found, so
long as we regard the <em>bulk</em> of the heated body.
Thus, an iron rod when hot is both longer and
thicker than when cold; and the difference of dimension,
though but trifling in itself, is yet capable
of being made sensible, and is of considerable consequence
in engineering. Thus, too, the quicksilver
in a common thermometer occupies a larger space<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
when hot than when cold; and being confined by
the glass ball, (which also expands, but <em>not so much
in proportion</em>,) it is forced to rise in the tube. These
and similar facts had long been known; and accurate
measures of the total amount of dilatation of
a variety of different bodies, under similar accessions
of heat, had been obtained and registered in tables.
But no one had suspected the important fact, that
this expansion in crystallized bodies takes place
under totally different circumstances from what
obtains in uncrystallized ones. M. Mitscherlich has
lately shown that such substances expand differently
in different directions, and has even produced a
case in which expansion in one direction is actually
accompanied with contraction in another. This
step, the most important beyond a doubt which
has yet been made in pyrometry, can however only
be regarded as the first in a series of researches
which will occupy the next generation, and which
promises to afford an abundant harvest of new
facts, as well as the elucidation of some of the
most obscure and interesting points in the doctrine
of heat.</p>

<p>(267.) From what has been said, it is clear that if
we look upon solid bodies as collections of particles
or atoms, held together and kept in their places by
the perpetual action of attractive and repulsive
forces, we cannot suppose these forces, at least in
crystallized substances, to act alike in all directions.
Hence arises the conception of <em>polarity</em>, of which we
see an instance, on a great scale, in the magnetic
needle, but which, under modified forms, there is
nothing to prevent us from conceiving to act among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the ultimate atoms of solid or even fluid bodies,
and to produce all the phenomena which they
exhibit in their crystallized state, either when acting
on each other, or on light, heat, &amp;c. It is not difficult,
if we give the reins to imagination, to conceive
how attractive and repulsive atoms, bound together
by some unknown tie, may form little machines or
compound particles, which shall have many of the
properties which we refer to polarity; and accordingly
many ingenious suppositions have been made
to that effect: but in the actual state of science it
is certainly safest to wave these hypotheses, without
however absolutely rejecting them, and regard the
<em>polarity of matter</em> as one of the ultimate phenomena
to which the analysis of nature leads us, and of
which it is our business fully to investigate the laws,
before we endeavour to ascertain its causes, or trace
the mechanism by which it is produced.</p>

<p>(268.) The mutual attractions and repulsions of the
particles of matter, then, and their polarity, whether
regarded as an original or a derivative property, are
the forces which, acting with great energy, and
within very confined limits, we must look to as the
principles on which the intimate constitution of all
bodies and many of their mutual actions depend.
These are what are understood by the general term
of <em>molecular forces</em>. Molecular attraction has been
attempted to be confounded by some with the
general attraction of gravity, which all matter exerts
on all other matter; but this idea is refuted by the
plainest facts.</p>

</div>

<p class="center b2">OF THE COMMUNICATION OF MOTION THROUGH
BODIES.—OF SOUND AND LIGHT.</p>

<p class="in0">(269.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> propagation of motion through all substances,
whether of a single impulse, as a blow or
thrust, or of one frequently and regularly repeated,
such as a jarring or vibratory movement, depends
wholly on these molecular forces; and it is on such
propagation that sound and very probably light depend.
To conceive the manner in which a motion may
be conveyed from one part of a substance to another,
whether solid or fluid, we may attend to what takes
place when a wave is made to run along a stretched
string, or the surface of still water. Every part of
the string, or water, is in succession moved from its
place, and agitated with a motion similar to that of
the original impulse, leaving its place and returning
to it, and when one part ceases to move the next
receives as it were the impression, and forwards it
onward. This may seem a slow and circuitous process
in description; but when sound, for example, is
conveyed through the air, we are to consider, 1st,
that the air, the substance actually in motion, is extremely
light and acted upon by a very powerful
elasticity, so that the force which propagates the
motion, or by which the particles adjacent act on,
and urge forward, each other, is very great, compared
with the quantity of materials set in motion by it:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and the same is true, even in a greater degree, in
liquids and solids; for in these the elastic forces
are even greater, in proportion to the weight, than
in air.</p>

<p>(270.) A general notion of the mode in which
sounds are conveyed through the air was not altogether
deficient among the ancients; but it is to
Newton that we owe the first attempt to analyze
the process, and show correctly what takes place in
the communication of motion from particle to particle.
Reasoning on the properties of the air as an
elastic body, he showed the effect of an impulse on
any portion of it to consist in a condensation of
the air immediately adjacent in the direction of the
impulse, which then, re-acting by its spring, drives
back the portion which had advanced to its original
place, and at the same time urges forward the portion
before it, in the direction of the impulse, so
that every particle alternately advances and retreats.
But, in pursuing this idea into its details, Newton
fell into some errors which were pointed out by
Cramer, though their origin was not traced, nor the
reasoning corrected, till the subject was resumed by
Lagrange and Euler; nor is this any impeachment
of the penetration of our immortal countryman. The
mathematical theory of the propagation of sound,
and of vibratory and undulatory motions in general,
is one of the utmost intricacy; and, in spite of every
exertion on the part of the most expert geometers,
continues to this day to give continual occasion for
fresh researches; while phenomena are constantly
presenting themselves, which show how far we are
from being able to deduce all the particulars, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
of cases comparatively simple, by any direct reasoning
from first principles.</p>

<p>(271.) Whenever an impulse of any kind is conveyed
by the air, to our ears, it produces the impression
of sound; but when such an impulse is
regularly and uniformly repeated in extremely rapid
succession, it gives us that of a musical note, the
pitch of the note depending on the rapidity of the
succession (see <a href="#p153">art. 153</a>.). The sense of harmony,
too, depends on the periodical recurrence of coincident
impulses on the ear, and affords, perhaps, the
only instance of a sensation for whose pleasing impression
a distinct and intelligible reason can be
assigned.</p>

<p>(272.) Acoustics, then, or the science of sound,
is a very considerable branch of physics, and one
which has been cultivated from the earliest ages.
Even Pythagoras and Aristotle were not ignorant of
the general mode of its transmission through the
air, and of the nature of harmony; but as a branch
of science, independent of its delightful application
in the art of music, it could be hardly said to exist,
till its nature and laws became a matter of experimental
enquiry to Bacon and Galileo, Mersenne and
Wallis; and of mathematical investigation to Newton,
and his illustrious successors, Lagrange and Euler.
From that time its progress, as a branch both of
mathematical and experimental science, has been
constant and accelerated. A curious and beautiful
method of observation, due to Chladni, consists in
the happy device of strewing sand over the surfaces
of bodies in a state of sonorous vibration, and marking
the figures it assumes. This has made their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
motions susceptible of ocular examination, and has
been lately much improved on, and varied in its application,
by M. Savart, to whom we also owe a succession
of instructive researches on every point
connected with the subject of sound, which may
rank among the finest specimens of modern experimental
enquiry. But the subject is far from being
exhausted; and, indeed, there are few branches of
physics which promise at once so much amusing interest,
and such important consequences, in its
bearings on other subjects, and especially, through
the medium of strong analogies, on that of light.</p>

<h3><i>Light and Vision.</i></h3>

<p>(273.) The nature of light has always been involved
in considerable doubt and mystery. The ancients
could scarcely be said to have any opinion on the
subject, unless, indeed, it could be considered such
to affirm that distant bodies could not be put into
communication without an intermedium; and that,
therefore, there must be <em>something</em> between the eye
and the thing seen. What that something is, however,
they could only form crude and vague conjectures.
One supposed that the eyes themselves
emit rays or emanations of some unknown kind, by
which distant objects are as it were felt; a singularly
unfortunate idea, since it gives no reason why
objects should not be equally well seen in the dark—no
account, in short, of the part performed by <em>light</em>
in vision. Others imagined that all visible objects are
constantly throwing out from them, in all directions,
some sort of resemblances or spectral forms of
themselves, which, when received by the eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
produce an impression of the objects. Vague and
clumsy as this hypothesis obviously is, it assigns to
the object a power, and to light a diffusive propagation
in all directions, which are, the one and the
other, independent of our eyes, and therefore goes
to separate the phenomena of <em>light</em> from those of
<em>vision</em>.</p>

<p>(274.) The hypothesis of Newton is a refinement
and improvement on this idea. Instead of spectra or
resemblances, he supposes luminous objects actually
to dart out from them in all directions, particles, of
inconceivable minuteness (as indeed they must be,
having such an enormous velocity (see <a href="#p17">17</a>.), not to
dash in pieces every thing they strike upon). These
particles he supposes to be acted upon by attractive
and repulsive forces, residing in all material bodies,
the latter extending to some very small distance
beyond their surfaces; and by the action of these
forces to be turned aside from their natural straight-lined
course, without ever coming in actual contact
with the particles themselves of the bodies on which
they fall, but either being turned back and <em>reflected</em>
by the repulsive forces before they reach them, or
penetrating between their intervals, as a bird may
be supposed to fly through the branches of a forest,
and undergoing all their actions, to take at quitting
them a direction finally determined by the position
of the surface at which they emerge with respect
to their course.</p>

<p>(275.) This hypothesis, which was discussed and
reasoned upon by Newton in a manner worthy of
himself, affords, by the application of the same
dynamical laws which he had applied with so much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
success to the explanation of the planetary motions,
not merely a plausible, but a perfectly reasonable
and fair explanation of all the <em>usual</em> phenomena of
light known in his time. His own beautiful discoveries,
too, of the different refrangibilities of
the differently coloured rays, were perfectly well
represented in this theory, by simply admitting a
difference of velocity in the particles, which produce
in the eye the sensations of different colours. And had
the properties of light remained confined to these,
there would have been no occasion to have resorted
to any other mode of conceiving it.</p>

<p>(276.) A very different hypothesis had, however,
been suggested about the same period by Huyghens,
who supposed light to be produced in the same
manner with sound, by the communication of a
vibratory motion from the luminous body to a
highly elastic fluid, which he imagined as filling all
space, and as being less condensed within the limits
of space occupied by matter, and that to a greater or
less extent, according to the nature of the occupying
substance. Thus, in place of any thing actually
thrown off, he substituted waves, or vibrations, propagated
in all directions from luminous bodies,
through this medium, or ether, as he called it.
Huyghens, being himself a consummate mathematician,
was enabled to trace many of the consequences
of this hypothesis, and to show that the
ordinary laws of reflection and refraction were represented
or accounted for by it, as well as by Newton’s.
But the hypothesis of Huyghens has not been fully
successful in accounting for what may be considered
the chief of all optical facts, the production of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
colours in the ordinary refraction of light by a prism,
of which the theory of Newton gives a complete
and elegant explanation; and the discovery of
which by him marks one of the greatest epochs in
the annals of experimental science. This, which has
been often urged in objection to it, remains still,
if not quite unanswered, at least only imperfectly
removed.</p>

<p>(277.) Other phenomena, however, were not
wanting to afford a further trial of the <em>explanatory
powers</em> of either hypothesis. The diffraction or
inflection of light, discovered by Grimaldi, a Jesuit
of Bologna, seemed to indicate that the rays of
light were turned aside from their straight course
by merely passing near bodies of every description.
These phenomena, which are very curious
and beautiful, were minutely examined by Newton,
and referred by him to the action of repulsive forces
extending to a sensible distance from the surfaces
of bodies; and his explanation, so far as the facts
known to him are concerned, appears as satisfactory
as could reasonably be then expected; and much
more so than any thing which could at that time be
produced on the side of the hypothesis of Huyghens,
which, in fact, seemed incapable of giving
any account whatever of them.</p>

<p>(278.) Another class of delicate and splendid
optical phenomena, which had begun to attract attention
somewhat previous to Newton’s time, seemed
to leave both hypotheses equally at a loss. These
were the colours exhibited by very thin films,
either of a liquid (such as a soap-bubble), or of air,
as when two glasses are laid together with only air<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
between them. These colours were examined by
Newton with a minuteness and care altogether unexampled
in experimental philosophy at that time,
and with which few researches undertaken since
will bear to stand in competition. Their result was
a theory of a very singular nature, which he
grounded on an hypothesis of what he termed <em>fits
of easy transmission and reflection</em>; and which supposed
each ray of light to pass in its progress
periodically through a succession of states such as
would alternately dispose it to penetrate or be
reflected back from the surface of a body on which
it might fall. The simplest way in which the reader
may conceive this hypothesis, is to regard every
particle of light as a sort of little magnet revolving
rapidly about its own centre while it advances in its
course, and thus alternately presenting its attractive
and repulsive pole, so that when it arrives at the
surface of a body with its repulsive pole foremost,
it is repelled and reflected; and when the contrary,
attracted, so as to enter the surface. Newton,
however, very cautiously avoided announcing his
theory in this or any similar form, confining himself
entirely to general language. In consequence, it
has been confidently asserted by all his followers,
that the doctrine of fits of easy reflection and transmission,
as laid down by him, is substantially nothing
more than a statement of facts. Were it so, it is
clear that any other theory which should offer a
just account of the same phenomena must ultimately
involve and coincide with that of Newton. But
this, as we shall presently see, is not the case; and
this instance ought to serve to make us extremely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
cautious how we employ, in stating physical laws
derived from experiment, language which involves
any thing in the slightest degree theoretical, if we
would present the laws themselves in a form which
no future research shall modify or subvert.</p>

<p>(279.) A third class of optical phenomena, which
were likewise discovered while Newton was yet
engaged in his optical researches, was that exhibited
by doubly refracting crystals. In what the phenomenon
of double refraction consists, we have already
had occasion to explain. The fact itself was first
noticed by Erasmus Bartolin in the crystal called
Iceland spar; and was studied with attention by
Huyghens, who ascertained its laws, and referred it
with remarkable ingenuity and success to his theory
of light, by the additional hypothesis of such a constitution
of his ethereal medium within the crystal
as should enable it to convey an impulse faster in
one direction than another: as if, for example’s
sake, we should suppose a sound conveyed through
the air with different degrees of rapidity in a vertical
and horizontal direction.</p>

<p>(280.) Some remarkable facts accompanying the
double refraction produced by Iceland spar, which
Bartolin, Huyghens, and Newton, had observed, led
the latter to conceive the singular idea that a ray of
light after its emergence from such a crystal acquires
<em>sides</em>, that is to say, distinct relations to surrounding
space, which it carries with it through its whole
subsequent course, and which give rise to all those
curious and complicated phenomena which are now
known under the name of the <em>polarization of light</em>.
These results, however, appeared so extraordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and offered so little handle for further enquiry, that
their examination dropped, as if by common consent;
Newton himself resting content with urging
strongly the apparent incompatibility of these properties
with the Huyghenian doctrine, but without
making any attempt to explain them by his own.</p>

<p>(281.) From the period of Newton’s optical discoveries
to the commencement of the present century,
no great accession to our knowledge of the
nature of light was made, if we except one,
which, from its invaluable practical application,
must ever hold a prominent place in the annals both
of art and science: we mean, the discovery of the
principle of the achromatic telescope, which originated
in a discussion between the celebrated
geometer Euler, Klingenstierna, an eminent Swedish
philosopher, and our own countryman, the admirable
optician Dollond, on the occasion of certain abstract
theoretical investigations of the former, which led
him to speculate on its <em>possibility</em>, and which ultimately
terminated in its complete and happy <em>execution</em>
by the latter; a memorable case in science,
though not a singular one, where the speculative
geometer in his chamber, apart from the world,
and existing among abstractions, has originated
views of the noblest practical application.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p>(282.) The explanation which our knowledge of
optical laws affords of the mechanism of the eye, and
the process by which vision is performed, is as complete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
and satisfactory as that of hearing by the propagation
of motion through the air. The camera obscura,
invented by Baptista Porta in 1560, gave the
first idea how the actual images of external objects
might be conveyed into the eye, but it was not till
after a considerable interval that Kepler, the immortal
discoverer of those great laws which regulate
the periods and motions of the planets, pointed
out distinctly the offices performed by the several
parts of the eye in the act of vision. From this to
the invention of the telescope and microscope
there would seem but a small step, but it is to accident
rather than design that it is due; and its re-invention
by Galileo, on a mere description of its
effects, may serve, among a thousand similar instances,
to show that inestimable practical applications
lie open to us, if we can only once bring
ourselves to conceive their possibility, a lesson
which the invention of the achromatic telescope itself,
as we have above related it, not less strongly
exemplifies.</p>

<p>(283.) The little instrument with which Galileo’s
splendid discoveries were made was hardly superior
in power to an ordinary finder of the present day;
but it was rapidly improved on, and in the hands of
Huyghens attained to gigantic dimensions and very
great power. It was to obviate the necessity of the
enormous length required for these telescopes, and
yet secure the same power, that Gregory and Newton
devised the reflecting telescope, which has since
become a much more powerful instrument than its
original inventors probably ever contemplated.</p>

<p>(284.) The telescope, as it exists at present, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
the improvements in its structure and execution
which modern artists have effected, must assuredly
be ranked among the highest and most refined
productions of human art; that in which man has
been able to approximate most closely to the
workmanship of nature, and which has conferred
upon him, if not another sense, at least an exaltation
of one already possessed by him that merits
almost to be regarded as a new one. Nor does it
appear yet to have reached its ultimate perfection,
to which indeed it is difficult to assign any bounds,
when we take into consideration the wonderful
progress which workmanship of every kind is
making, and the delicacy, far superior to that of
former times, with which materials may now be
wrought, as well as the ingenious inventions and
combinations which every year is bringing forth
for accomplishing the same ends by means hitherto
unattempted.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>(285.) After a long torpor, the knowledge of the
properties of light began to make fresh progress
about the end of the last century, advancing with
an accelerated rapidity, which has continued unabated
to the present time. The example was set
by our late admirable and lamented countryman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Dr. Wollaston, who re-examined and verified the
laws of double refraction in Iceland spar announced
by Huyghens. Attention being thus drawn to the
subject, the geometry of Laplace soon found a means
of explaining at least one portion of the mystery
of this singular phenomenon, by the Newtonian
theory of light, applied under certain supposed conditions;
and the reasoning which led him to the result
(at that time quite unexpected), may justly be
regarded as one of his happiest efforts. The prosecution
of the subject, which had now acquired a
high degree of interest, was encouraged by the offer
of a prize on the part of the French Academy of
Sciences; and it was in a memoir which received this
honourable reward on that occasion, in 1810, that
Malus, a retired officer of engineers in the French
army, announced the great discovery of the <em>polarization
of light</em> by ordinary reflection at the surface of
a transparent body.</p>

<p>(286.) Malus found that when a beam of light is
reflected from the surface of such a body at a certain
angle, it acquires precisely the same singular property
which is impressed upon it in the act of double
refraction, and which Newton had before expressed
by saying that it possessed <em>sides</em>. This was the first
circumstance which pointed out a connection between
that hitherto mysterious phenomenon and
any of the ordinary modifications of light; and it
proved ultimately the means of bringing the whole
within the limits, if not of a complete explanation,
at least of a highly plausible theoretical representation.
So true is, in science, the remark of Bacon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
that no natural phenomenon can be adequately
studied <em>in itself alone</em>, but, to be understood, must
be considered <em>as it stands connected with all nature</em>.</p>

<p>(287.) The new class of phenomena thus disclosed
were immediately studied with diligence and success,
both abroad by Malus and Arago, and at
home by our countryman Dr. Brewster, and their
laws investigated with a care proportioned to their
importance; when another and apparently still more
extraordinary class of phenomena presented itself
in the production of the most vivid and beautiful
colours (every way resembling those observed by
Newton in thin films of air or liquids, only infinitely
more developed and striking,) in certain transparent
crystallized substances, when divided into flat plates
in particular directions, and exposed in a beam of
polarized light. The attentive examination of these
colours by Wollaston, Biot, and Arago, but more
especially by Brewster, speedily led to the disclosure
of a series of optical phenomena so various, so
brilliant, and evidently so closely connected with the
most important points relating to the intimate structure
of crystallized bodies, as to excite the highest
interest,—that sort of interest which is raised when
we feel we are on the eve of some extraordinary
discovery, and expect every moment that some leading
fact will turn up, which will throw light on all
that appears obscure, and reduce into order all that
seems anomalous.</p>

<p>(288.) This expectation was not disappointed.
So long before the time we are speaking of as the
first year of the present century, our illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
countryman, the late Dr. Thomas Young, had established
a principle in optics, which, regarded as a
physical law, has hardly its equal for beauty, simplicity,
and extent of application, in the whole circle
of science. Considering the manner in which the
vibrations of two musical sounds arriving at once at
the ear affect the sense with an impression of sound
or silence according as they conspire or oppose
each other’s effects, he was led to the idea that
the same ought to hold good with light as with
sound, if the theory which makes light analogous to
sound be the true one; and that, therefore, two rays
of light, setting off from the same origin, at the same
instant, and arriving at the same place by different
routes, ought to strengthen or wholly or partially
destroy each other’s effects according to the difference
in length of the routes described by them.
That two lights should in any circumstances combine
to produce darkness may be considered strange,
but is <em>literally true</em>; and it had even been noticed
long ago as a singular and unaccountable fact by
Grimaldi, in his experiments on the inflection of
light. The experimental means by which Dr. Young
confirmed this principle, which is known in optics
by the name of the <em>interference</em> of the rays of light,
were as simple and satisfactory as the principle
itself is beautiful; but the verifications of it, drawn
from the explanation it affords of phenomena apparently
the most remote, are still more so. Newton’s
colours of thin films were the first phenomena to
which its author applied it with full success. Its
next remarkable application was to those of diffraction,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
of which, in the hands of M. Fresnel, a late
eminent French geometer, it also furnished a complete
explanation, and that, too, in cases to which
Newton’s hypothesis could not apparently be made
to apply, and through a complication of circumstances
which might afford a very severe test of
any hypothesis.</p>

<p>(289.) A simple and beautiful experiment on the
interferences of polarized light due to Fresnel and
Arago enabled them to bring Dr. Young’s law to
bear on the colours produced by crystallized plates
in a polarized beam, and by so doing afforded a
key to all the intricacies of these magnificent but
complex phenomena. Nothing now was wanting to
a rational theory of double refraction but to frame
an hypothesis of some mode in which light might
be conceived to be propagated through the elastic
medium supposed to convey it in such a way as not
to be contradictory to any of the facts, nor to
the general laws of dynamics. This essential idea,
without which every thing that had been before
done would have been incomplete, was also furnished
by Dr. Young, who, with a sagacity which
would have done honour to Newton himself, had
declared, that to accommodate the doctrine of
Huyghens to the phenomena of polarized light it is
necessary to conceive the mode of propagation of
a luminous impulse through the ether, differently
from that of a sonorous one through the air. In the
latter, the particles of the air <em>advance</em> and <em>recede</em>;
in the former, those of the ether must be supposed
to <em>tremble laterally</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
(290.) Taking this as the groundwork of his
reasoning, Fresnel succeeded in erecting on it a
theory of polarization and double refraction, so
happy in its adaptation to facts, and in the coincidence
with experience of results deduced from it
by the most intricate analysis, that it is difficult to
conceive it unfounded. If it be so, it is at least the
most curiously artificial system that science has yet
witnessed; and whether it be so or not, so long as
it serves to group together in one comprehensive
point of view a mass of facts almost infinite in
number and variety, to reason from one to another,
and to establish analogies and relations between
them; on whatever hypothesis it may be founded,
or whatever arbitrary assumptions it may make
respecting structures and modes of action, it can
never be regarded as other than a most real and
important accession to our knowledge.</p>

<p>(291.) Still, it is by no means impossible that the
Newtonian theory of light, if cultivated with equal
diligence with the Huyghenian, might lead to an
equally plausible explanation of phenomena now
regarded as beyond its reach. M. Biot is the author
of the hypothesis we have already mentioned
of a rotatory motion of the particles of light about
their axes. He has employed it only for a very
limited purpose; but it might doubtless be carried
much farther; and by admitting only the regular
emission of the luminous particles at equal intervals
of time, and in similar states of motion from the
shining body, which does not seem a very forced supposition,
all the phenomena of interference at least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
would be readily enough explained without the admission
of an ether.</p>

<p>(292.) The optical examination of crystallized
substances affords one among many fine examples
of the elucidation which every branch of science is
capable of affording to every other. The indefatigable
researches of Dr. Brewster and others have
shown that the phenomena exhibited by polarized
light in its transmission through crystals afford a
certain indication of the most important points
relating to the structure of the crystals themselves,
and thus become most valuable characters by which
to recognise their internal constitution. It was
Newton who first showed of what importance as a
physical character,—as the indication of other properties,—the
action of a body on light might become;
but the characters afforded by the use of polarized
light as an instrument of experimental enquiry are
so marked and intimate, that they may almost be
said to have furnished us with a kind of intellectual
sense, by which we are enabled to scrutinize the
internal arrangement of those wonderful structures
which Nature builds up by her refined and invisible
architecture, with a delicacy eluding our conception,
yet with a symmetry and beauty which we are never
weary of admiring. In this point of view the science
of optics has rendered to mineralogy and crystallography
services not less important than to astronomy
by the invention of the telescope, or to natural history
by that of the microscope; while the relations
which have been discovered to exist between the
optical properties of bodies and their crystalline forms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
and even their chemical habitudes, have afforded
numerous and beautiful instances of general laws
concluded from laborious and painful induction, and
curiously exemplifying the simplicity of nature as it
emerges slowly from an entangled mass of particulars
in which, at first, neither order nor connection can
be traced.</p>

<h3><i>Astronomy and Celestial Mechanics.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">(293.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">A</span>stronomy,</span> as has been observed in the
former part of this discourse, as a science of observation,
had made considerable progress among the
ancients: indeed, it was the only branch of physical
science which could be regarded as having been cultivated
by them with any degree of assiduity or real
success. The Chaldean and Egyptian records had
furnished materials from which the motions of the
sun and moon could be calculated with sufficient exactness
for the prediction of eclipses; and some remarkable
cycles, or periods of years in which the
lunar eclipses return in very nearly the same order,
had been ascertained by observation. Considering
the extreme imperfection of their means of measuring
time and space, this was, perhaps, as much as could
have been expected at that early period, and it was
followed up for a while in a philosophical spirit of
just speculation, which, if continued, could hardly
have failed to lead to sound and important conclusions.</p>

<p>(294.) Unfortunately, however, the philosophy of
Aristotle laid it down as a principle, that the celestial
motions were regulated by laws proper to themselves,
and bearing no affinity to those which prevail on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
earth. By thus drawing a broad and impassable line
of separation between celestial and terrestrial mechanics,
it placed the former altogether out of the
pale of experimental research, while it at the same
time impeded the progress of the latter by the assumption
of principles respecting natural and unnatural
motions, hastily adopted from the most
superficial and cursory remark, undeserving even
the name of observation. Astronomy, therefore, continued
for ages a science of mere record, in which
theory had no part, except in so far as it attempted
to conciliate the inequalities of the celestial motions
with that assumed law of uniform circular revolution
which was alone considered consistent with the perfection
of the heavenly mechanism. Hence arose
an unwieldy, if not self-contradictory, mass of hypothetical
motions of sun, moon, and planets, in circles,
whose centres were carried round in other circles,
and these again in others without end,—“cycle on
epicycle, orb on orb,”—till at length, as observation
grew more exact, and fresh epicycles were continually
added, the absurdity of so cumbrous a mechanism
became too palpable to be borne. Doubts were expressed,
to which the sarcasm of a monarch<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> gave a
currency they might not have obtained in a period
when men scarcely dared trust themselves to think;
and at length Copernicus, promulgating his own, or
reviving the Pythagorean doctrine, which places
the sun in the centre of our system, gave to astronomy
a simplicity which, contrasted with the complication
of the preceding views, at once commanded
assent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
(295.) An elegant writer<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>, whom we have before
had occasion to quote, has briefly and neatly accounted
for the confused notions which so long prevailed
respecting the constitution of our system,
and the difficulty experienced in acquiring a true
notion of the disposition of its parts. “We see it,”
he observes, “not in <em>plan</em>, but in <em>section</em>.” The
reason of this is, that our point of observation
lies in its general plane, but the notion we aim at
forming of it is not that of its section, but of its plan.
This is as if we should attempt to read a book, or
make out the countries on a map, with the eye on a
level with the paper. We can only judge directly
of the distances of objects by their sizes, or rather
of their change of distance by their change of size;
neither have we any means of ascertaining, otherwise
than indirectly, even their positions, one among the
other, from their apparent places as seen by us. Now,
the variations in apparent size of the sun and moon
are too small to admit of exact measure without the
use of the telescope, and the bodies of the planets
cannot even be distinguished as having any distinct
size with the naked eye.</p>

<p>(296.) The Copernican system once admitted, however,
this difficulty of conception, at least, is effectually
got over, and it becomes a mere problem of geometry
and calculation to determine, from the observed
places of a planet, its real orbit about the sun, and
the other circumstances of its motion. This Kepler
accomplished for the orbit of Mars, which he ascertained
to be an ellipse having the sun in one of its
foci; and the same law, being extended by inductive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
analogy to all the planets, was found to be verified in
the case of each. This with the other remarkable
laws which are usually cited in physical astronomy
by the name of Kepler’s laws, constitute undoubtedly
the most important and beautiful system of
geometrical relations which have ever been discovered
by a mere inductive process, independent of
any consideration of a theoretical kind. They comprise
within them a compendium of the motions of
all the planets, and enable us to assign their places
in their orbits at any instant of time past or to come
(disregarding their mutual perturbations), provided
certain purely geometrical problems can be numerically
resolved.</p>

<p>(297.) It was not, however, till long after Kepler’s
time that the real importance of these laws could be
felt. Regarded in themselves, they offered, it is true,
a fine example of regular and harmonious disposition
in the greatest of all the works of creation, and a
striking contrast to the cumbersome mechanism of
the cycles and epicycles which preceded them; but
there their utility seemed to terminate, and, indeed,
Kepler was reproached, and not without a semblance
of reason, with having rendered the actual calculation
of the places of the planets more difficult
than before, the resources of geometry being then
inadequate to resolve the problems to which the
strict application of his laws gave rise.</p>

<p>(298.) The first result of the invention of the
telescope and its application to astronomical purposes,
by Galileo, was the discovery of Jupiter’s
disc and satellites,—of a system offering a beautiful
miniature of that greater one of which it forms a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
portion, and presenting to the eye of sense, at a
single glance, that disposition of parts which in the
planetary system itself is discerned only by the eye of
reason and imagination (see <a href="#p195">195</a>.). Kepler had the
satisfaction of seeing it ascertained, that the law which
he had discovered to connect the times of revolution
of the planets with their distances from the sun, holds
good also when applied to the periods of circulation
of these little attendants round the centre of their
principal; thus demonstrating it to be something
more than a mere empirical rule, and to depend on
the intimate nature of planetary motion itself.</p>

<p>(299.) It had been objected to the doctrine of
Copernicus, that, were it true, Venus should appear
sometimes horned like the moon. To this he answered
by admitting the conclusion, and averring
that, should we ever be able to see its actual shape,
it <em>would</em> appear so. It is easy to imagine with what
force the application would strike every mind when
the telescope confirmed this prediction, and showed
the planet just as both the philosopher and his objectors
had agreed it ought to appear. The history
of science affords perhaps only one instance analogous
to this. When Dr. Hutton expounded his theory of
the consolidation of rocks by the application of heat,
at a great depth below the bed of the ocean, and
especially of that of marble by actual fusion; it was
objected that, whatever might be the case with
others, with calcareous or marble rocks, at least, it
was impossible to grant such a cause of consolidation,
since heat decomposes their substance and
converts it into quicklime, by driving off the carbonic
acid, and leaving a substance perfectly infusible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and incapable even of agglutination by heat.
To this he replied, that the pressure under which
the heat was applied would prevent the escape of
the carbonic acid; and that being retained, it might
be expected to give that fusibility to the compound
which the simple quicklime wanted. The next
generation saw this anticipation converted into an
observed fact, and verified by the direct experiments
of Sir James Hall, who actually succeeded in melting
marble, by retaining its carbonic acid under
violent pressure.</p>

<p>(300.) Kepler, among a number of vague and
even wild speculations on the causes of the motions
whose laws he had developed so beautifully and
with so much patient labour, had obtained a glimpse
of the general law of the inertia of matter, as applicable
to the great masses of the heavenly bodies
as well as to those with which we are conversant
on the earth. After Kepler, Galileo, while he gave
the finishing blow to the Aristotelian dogmas which
erected a barrier between the laws of celestial and
terrestrial motion, by his powerful argument and
caustic ridicule, contributed, by his investigations
of the laws of falling bodies and the motions of projectiles,
to lay the foundation of a true system of
dynamics, by which motions could be determined
from a knowledge of the forces producing them,
and forces from the motions they produce. Hooke
went yet farther, and obtained a view so distinct of
the mode in which the planets might be retained
in their orbits by the sun’s attraction, that, had his
mathematical attainments been equal to his philosophical
acumen, and his scientific pursuits been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
less various and desultory, it can hardly be doubted
that he would have arrived at a knowledge of the
law of gravitation.</p>

<p>(301.) But every thing which had been done towards
this great end, before Newton, could only be
regarded as smoothing some first obstacles, and
preparing a state of knowledge, in which powers
like his could be effectually exerted. His wonderful
combination of mathematical skill with physical
research enabled him to invent, at pleasure, new and
unheard-of methods of investigating the effects of
those causes which his clear and penetrating mind
detected in operation. Whatever department of
science he touched, he may be said to have formed
afresh. Ascending by a series of close-compacted
inductive arguments to the highest axioms of dynamical
science, he succeeded in applying them to
the complete explanation of all the great astronomical
phenomena, and many of the minuter and more
enigmatical ones. In doing this, he had every thing
to create: the mathematics of his age proved
totally inadequate to grapple with the numerous
difficulties which were to be overcome; but this,
so far from discouraging him, served only to afford
new opportunities for the exertion of his genius,
which, in the invention of the method of fluxions,
or, as it is now more generally called, the differential
calculus, has supplied a means of discovery, bearing
the same proportion to the methods previously in
use, that the steam-engine does to the mechanical
powers employed before its invention. Of the optical
discoveries of Newton we have already spoken; and
if the magnitude of the objects of his astronomical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
discoveries excite our admiration of the mental
powers which could so familiarly grasp them, the
minuteness of the researches into which he there
set the first example of entering, is no less calculated
to produce a corresponding impression.
Whichever way we turn our view, we find ourselves
compelled to bow before his genius, and to assign
to the name of <span class="smcap">Newton</span> a place in our veneration
which belongs to no other in the annals of science.
His era marks the accomplished maturity of the
human reason as applied to such objects. Every
thing which went before might be more properly
compared to the first imperfect attempts of childhood,
or the essays of inexpert, though promising,
adolescence. Whatever has been since performed,
however great in itself, and worthy of so splendid
and auspicious a beginning, has never, in point of
intellectual effort, surpassed that astonishing one
which produced the Principia.</p>

<p>(302.) In this great work, Newton shows all the
celestial motions known in his time to be consequences
of the simple law, that every particle of
matter attracts every other particle in the universe
with a force proportional to the product of their
masses directly, and the square of their mutual
distance inversely, and is itself attracted with an
equal force. Setting out from this, he explains how
an attraction arises between the great spherical
masses of which our system consists, regulated by
a law precisely similar in its expression; how the
elliptic motions of planets about the sun, and of
satellites about their primaries, according to the
exact rules inductively arrived at by Kepler, result<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
as necessary consequences from the same general
law of force; and how the orbits of comets themselves
are only particular cases of planetary movements.
Thence proceeding to applications of greater
difficulty, he explains how the perplexing inequalities
of the moon’s motion result from the sun’s
disturbing action; how tides arise from the unequal
attraction of the sun as well as of the moon on the
earth, and the ocean which surrounds it; and, lastly,
how the precession of the equinoxes is a necessary
consequence of the very same law.</p>

<p>(303.) The immediate successors of Newton found
full occupation in verifying his discoveries, and in
extending and improving the mathematical methods
which it had now become manifest were to prove the
keys to an inexhaustible treasure of knowledge. The
simultaneous but independent discovery of a method
of mathematical investigation in every respect
similar to that of Newton, by Leibnitz, while it
created a degree of national jealousy which can now
only be regretted, had the effect of stimulating the
continental geometers to its cultivation, and impressing
on it a character more entirely independent
of the ancient geometry, to which Newton was
peculiarly attached. It was fortunate for science
that it did so; for it was speedily found that (with
one fine exception on the part of our countryman
Maclaurin, followed up, after a long interval, by the
late Professor Robison of Edinburgh, with equal
elegance,) the geometry of Newton was like the
bow of Ulysses, which none but its master could
bend; and that, to render his methods available
beyond the points to which he himself carried them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
it was necessary to strip them of every vestige of
that antique dress in which he had delighted to
clothe them. This, however, the countrymen of
Newton were very unwilling to do; and they paid
the penalty in finding themselves condemned to
the situation of lookers on, while their continental
neighbours both in Germany and France were pushing
forward in the career of mathematico-physical
discovery with emulous rapidity.</p>

<p>(304.) The legacy of research which Newton may
be said to have left to his successors was truly immense.
To pursue, through all its intricacies, the
consequences of the law of gravitation; to account
for all the inequalities of the planetary movements,
and the infinitely more complicated, and to us more
important ones, of the moon; and to give, what
Newton himself certainly never entertained a conception
of, a demonstration of the stability and
permanence of the system, under all the accumulating
influence of its internal perturbations; this
labour, and this triumph, were reserved for the succeeding
age, and have been shared in succession by
Clairaut, D’Alembert, Euler, Lagrange and Laplace.
Yet so extensive is the subject, and so difficult and
intricate the purely mathematical enquiries to which
it leads, that another century may yet be required
to go through with the task. The recent discoveries
of astronomers have supplied matter for investigation,
to the geometers of this and the next generation,
of a difficulty far surpassing any thing that had
before occurred. Five primary planets have been
added to our system; four of them since the commencement
of the present century, and these, singularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
deviating from the general analogy of the
others, and offering <em>cases of difficulty</em> in theory, which
no one had before contemplated. Yet even the intricate
questions to which these bodies have given
rise seem likely to be surpassed by those which have
come into view, with the discovery of several comets
revolving in elliptic orbits, like the planets, round the
sun, in very moderate periods. But the resources
of modern geometry seem, so far from being exhausted,
to increase with the difficulties they have
to encounter, and already, among the successors of
Lagrange and Laplace, the present generation has to
enumerate a powerful array of names, which promise
to render it not less celebrated in the annals of
physico-mathematical research than that which has
just passed away.</p>

<p>(305.) Meanwhile the positions, figures, and dimensions
of all the planetary orbits, are now well
known, and their variations from century to century
in great measure determined; and it has been generally
demonstrated, that all the changes which
the mutual actions of the planets on each other can
produce in the course of indefinite ages, are <em>periodical</em>,
that is to say, increasing to a certain extent
(and that never a very great one), and then
again decreasing; so that the system can never be
destroyed or subverted by the mutual action of its
parts, but keeps constantly oscillating, as it were,
round a certain mean state, from which it can never
deviate to any ruinous extent. In particular the
researches of Laplace, Lagrange, and Poisson, have
shown the ultimate invariability of the mean distance
of each planet from the sun, and consequently of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
periodic time. Relying on these grand discoveries,
we are enabled to look forward, from the point of
time which we now occupy, many thousands of years
into futurity, and predict the state of our system
without fear of material error, but such as may arise
from causes whose existence at present we have no
reason to suppose, or from interference which we
have no right to anticipate.</p>

<p>(306.) A correct enumeration and description of
the fixed stars in catalogues, and an exact knowledge
of their position, supply the only effectual
means we can have of ascertaining what changes
they are liable to, and what motions, too slow to deprive
them of their usual epithet, <em>fixed</em>, yet sufficient
to produce a sensible change in the lapse of ages,
may exist among them. Previous to the invention
of the compass, they served as guides to the navigator
by night; but for this purpose, a very moderate
knowledge of a few of the principal ones
sufficed. Hipparchus was the first astronomer, who,
excited by the appearance of a new star, conceived
the idea of forming a catalogue of the stars, with a
view to its use as an astronomical record, “by
which,” says Pliny, “posterity will be able to discover,
not only whether they are born and die, but
also whether they change their places, and whether
they increase or decrease.” His catalogue, containing
more than 1000 stars, was constructed about 128
years before Christ. It was in the course of the laborious
discussion of his own and former observations
of them, undertaken with a view to the formation of
this catalogue, that he first recognised the fact of that
slow, general advance of all the stars eastward, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
compared with the place of the equinox, which is
known under the name of the precession of the
equinoxes, and which Newton succeeded in referring
to a motion in the earth’s axis, produced by the
attraction of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>(307.) Since Hipparchus, at various periods in the
history of astronomy, catalogues of stars have been
formed, among which that of Ulugh Begh, comprising
about 1000 stars, constructed in 1437, is remarkable
as the production of a sovereign prince, working personally
in conjunction with his astronomers; and that
of Tycho Brahe, containing 777 stars, constructed in
1600, as having originated in a phenomenon similar
to that which drew the attention of Hipparchus.
In more recent times, astronomers provided with
the finest instruments their respective eras could
supply, and established in observatories, munificently
endowed by the sovereigns and governments of
different European nations, have vied and are still
vying with each other, in extending the number of
registered stars, and giving the utmost possible
degree of accuracy to the determination of their
places. Among these, it would be ungrateful not to
claim especial notice for the superb series of observations
which, under a succession of indefatigable
and meritorious astronomers, has, for a very long
period, continued to emanate from our own national
observatory of Greenwich.</p>

<p>(308.) The distance of the fixed stars is so immense,
that every attempt to assign a limit, <em>within
which</em> it <em>must</em> fall, has hitherto failed. The enquiries
of astronomers of all ages have been directed to ascertain
this distance, by taking the dimensions of our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
particular system of sun and planets, or of the earth
itself, as the unit of a scale on which it might be
measured. But although many have imagined that
their observations afforded grounds for the decision
of this interesting point, it has uniformly happened
either that the phenomena on which they relied
have proved to be referable to other causes not
previously known, and which the superior accuracy
of their researches has for the first time brought to
light; or to errors arising from instrumental imperfections
and unavoidable defects of the observations
themselves.</p>

<p>(309.) The only indication we can expect to obtain
of the actual distance of a star, would consist
in an annual change in its apparent place corresponding
to the motion of the earth round the sun,
called its <em>annual parallax</em>, and which is nothing
more than the measure of the apparent size of the
earth’s orbit as seen from the star. Many observers
have thought they have detected a measurable
amount of this parallax; but as astronomical instruments
have advanced in perfection, the quantity
which they have successively assigned to it has
been continually reduced within narrower and narrower
limits, and has invariably been commensurate
with the errors to which the instruments used
might fairly be considered liable. The conclusion
this strongly presses on us is, that it is really a
quantity too small to admit of distinct measurement
in the present state of our means for that purpose;
and that, therefore, the distance of the stars must
be a magnitude of such an order as the imagination
almost shrinks from contemplating. But this increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
in our scale of dimension calls for a corresponding
enlargement of conception in all other
respects. The same reasoning which places the
stars at such immeasurable remoteness, exalts them
at the same time into glorious bodies, similar to, and
even far surpassing, our own sun, the centres perhaps
of other planetary systems, or fulfilling purposes
of which we can have no idea, from any analogy in
what passes immediately around us.</p>

<p>(310.) The comparison of catalogues, published
at different periods, has given occasion to many
curious remarks, respecting changes both of place
and brightness among the stars, to the discovery of
variable ones which lose and recover their lustre
periodically, and to that of the disappearance of
several from the heavens so completely as to have
left no vestige discernible even by powerful telescopes.
In proportion as the construction of astronomical
and optical instruments has gone on improving,
our knowledge of the contents of the heavens
has undergone a corresponding extension, and, at
the same time, attained a degree of precision which
could not have been anticipated in former ages.
The places of all the principal stars in the northern
hemisphere, and of a great many in the southern,
are now known to a degree of nicety which must
infallibly detect any real motions that may exist
among them, and has in fact done so, in a great
many instances, some of them very remarkable
ones.</p>

<p>(311.) It is only since a comparatively recent
date, however, that any great attention has been
bestowed on the smaller stars, among which there can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
be no doubt of the most interesting and instructive
phenomena being sooner or later brought to light.
The minute examination of them with powerful
telescopes, and with delicate instruments for the
determination of their places, has, indeed, already
produced immense catalogues and masses of observations,
in which thousands of stars invisible to the
naked eye are registered; and has led to the discovery
of innumerable important and curious facts,
and disclosed the existence of whole classes of celestial
objects, of a nature so wonderful as to give
room for unbounded speculation on the extent and
construction of the universe.</p>

<p>(312.) Among these, perhaps the most remarkable
are the revolving double stars, or stars which, to
the naked eye or to inferior telescopes, appear
single; but, if examined with high magnifying powers,
are found to consist of two individuals placed
almost close together, and which, when carefully
watched, are (many of them) found to revolve in
regular elliptic orbits about each other; and so far
as we have yet been able to ascertain, to obey the
same laws which regulate the planetary movements.
There is nothing calculated to give a grander idea
of the scale on which the sidereal heavens are
constructed than these beautiful systems. When we
see such magnificent bodies united in pairs, undoubtedly
by the same bond of mutual gravitation
which holds together our own system, and sweeping
over their enormous orbits, in periods comprehending
many centuries, we admit at once that they must
be accomplishing ends in creation which will remain
for ever unknown to man; and that we have here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
attained a point in science where the human intellect
is compelled to acknowledge its weakness, and to feel
that no conception the wildest imagination can form
will bear the least comparison with the intrinsic
greatness of the subject.</p>

<h3><i>Geology.</i></h3>

<p>(313.) The researches of physical astronomy are
confessedly incompetent to carry us back to the
origin of our system, or to a period when its state
was, in any great essential, different from what it is at
present. So far as the causes now in action go, and
so far as our calculations will enable us to estimate
their effects, we are equally unable to perceive in
the general phenomena of the planetary system
either the evidence of a beginning, or the prospect
of an end. Geometers, as already stated, have demonstrated
that, in the midst of all the fluctuations
which can possibly take place in the elements of the
orbits of the planets, by reason of their mutual attraction,
the general balance of the parts of the
system will always be preserved, and every departure
from a mean state periodically compensated.
But neither the researches of the physical astronomer,
nor those of the geologist, give us any
ground for regarding our system, or the globe we
inhabit, as of eternal duration. On the contrary,
there are circumstances in the physical constitution
of our own planet which at least obscurely point to
an origin and a formation, however remote, since it
has been found that the figure of the earth is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
globular but elliptical, and that its attraction is such
as requires us to admit the interior to be more dense
than the exterior, and the density to increase with
some degree of regularity from the surface towards
the centre, and <em>that</em>, in layers arranged elliptically
round the centre, circumstances which could scarcely
happen without some such successive deposition of
materials as would enable pressure to be propagated
with a certain degree of freedom from one part of
the mass to another, even if we should hesitate to
admit a state of primitive fluidity.</p>

<p>(314.) But from such indications nothing distinct
can be concluded; and if we would speculate to any
purpose on a former state of our globe and on the succession
of events which from time to time may have
changed the condition and form of its surface, we
must confine our views within limits far more
restricted, and to subjects much more within the
reach of our capacity, than either the creation of the
world or its assumption of its present figure. These,
indeed, were favourite speculations with a race of
geologists now extinct; but the science itself has
undergone a total change of character, even within
the last half century, and is brought, at length,
effectually within the list of the inductive sciences.
Geologists now no longer bewilder their imaginations
with wild theories of the formation of the globe
from chaos, or its passage through a series of hypothetical
transformations, but rather aim at a careful
and accurate examination of the records of its former
state, which they find indelibly impressed on the
great features of its actual surface, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
evidences of former life and habitation which organised
remains imbedded and preserved in its
strata indisputably afford.</p>

<p>(315.) Records of this kind are neither few nor
vague; and though the obsoleteness of their language
when we endeavour to interpret it too minutely, may,
and no doubt often does, lead to misapprehension,
still its general meaning is, on the whole, unequivocal
and satisfactory. Such records teach us, in
terms too plain to be misunderstood, that the whole
or nearly the whole of our present lands and continents
were formerly at the bottom of the sea,
where they received deposits of materials from the
wearing and degradation of other lands not now
existing, and furnished receptacles for the remains
of marine animals and plants inhabiting the ocean
above them, as well as for similar spoils of the land
washed down into its bosom.</p>

<p>(316.) These remains are occasionally brought
to light; and their examination has afforded indubitable
evidence of the former existence of a state of
animated nature widely different from what now
obtains on the globe, and of a period anterior to that
in which it has been the habitation of man, or
rather, indeed, of a series of periods, of unknown
duration, in which both land and sea teemed with
forms of animal and vegetable life, which have successively
disappeared and given place to others,
and these again to new races approximating gradually
more and more nearly to those which now inhabit
them, and at length comprehending species
which have their counterparts existing.</p>

<p>(317.) These wrecks of a former state of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
thus wonderfully preserved (like ancient medals and
inscriptions in the ruins of an empire), afford a sort
of rude chronology, by whose aid the successive depositions
of the strata in which they are found may
be marked out in epochs more or less definitely
terminated, and each characterized by some peculiarity
which enables us to recognise the deposits
of any period, in whatever part of the world they
may be found. And, so far as has been hitherto
investigated, the <em>order</em> of succession in which these
deposits have been formed appears to have been
the same in every part of the globe.</p>

<p>(318.) Many of the strata which thus bear evident
marks of having been deposited at the bottom
of the sea, and of course in a horizontal state, are
now found in a position highly inclined to the horizon,
and even occasionally vertical. And they
often bear no less evident marks of violence, in
their bending and fracture, the dislocation of parts
which were once contiguous, and the existence of
vast collections of broken fragments which afford
every proof of great violence having been used in
accomplishing some at least of the changes which
have taken place.</p>

<p>(319.) Besides the rocks which carry this internal
evidence of submarine deposition, are many
which exhibit no such proofs, but on the contrary
hold out every appearance of owing their origin to
volcanoes or to some other mode of igneous action;
and in every part of the world, and among strata
of all ages, there occur evidences of such action so
abundant, and on such a scale, as to point out the
volcano and the earthquake as agents which may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
have been instrumental in the production of those
changes of level, and those violent dislocations
which we perceive to have taken place.</p>

<p>(320.) At all events, in accounting for those
changes, geologists have no longer recourse, as formerly,
to causes purely hypothetical, such as
a shifting of the earth’s axis of rotation, bringing
the sea to overflow the land, by a change in the
place of the longer and shorter diameters of the
spheroidal figure, nor to tides produced by the attraction
of comets suddenly approaching very near
the earth, nor to any other fanciful and arbitrarily
assumed hypotheses; but rather endeavour to confine
themselves to a careful consideration of causes
evidently in action at present, with a view to ascertain
how far they, in the first instance, are capable
of accounting for the facts observed, and thus legitimately
bringing into view, as residual phenomena,
those effects which cannot be so accounted for.
When this shall have been in some measure accomplished,
we shall be able to pronounce with greater
security than at present respecting the necessity of
admitting a long succession of tremendous and
ravaging catastrophes and cataclysms,—epochs of
terrific confusion and violence which many geologists
(perhaps with justice) regard as indispensable
to the explanation of the existing features of
the world. We shall learn to distinguish between
the effects which require for their production the
sudden application of convulsive and fracturing
efforts, and those, probably not less extensive,
changes which may have been produced by forces
equally or more powerful, but acting with less irregularity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and so distributed over time as to produce
none of those <em>interregnums</em> of chaotic anarchy which
we are apt to think (perhaps erroneously) great disfigurements
of an order so beautiful and harmonious
as that of nature.</p>

<p>(321.) But to estimate justly the effects of
causes now in action in geology is no easy task.
There is no <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">à priori</i> or deductive process by which
we can estimate the amount of the annual erosion,
for instance, of a continent by the action of meteoric
agents, rain, wind, frost, &amp;c., nor the quantity of
destruction produced on its coasts by the direct
violence of the sea, nor the quantity of lava thrown
up <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per annum</i> by volcanoes over the whole surface
of the earth, nor any similar effect. And to consult
experience on all such points is a slow and
painful process if rightly gone into, and a very fallible
one if only partially executed. Much, then,
at present must be left to opinion, and to that sort
of clear-judging tact which sometimes anticipates
experience; but this ought not to stand in the way
of our making every possible effort to obtain accurate
information on such points, by which alone
geology can be rendered, if not an experimental
science, at least a science of that kind of active
observation which forms the nearest approach to it,
where actual experiment is impossible.</p>

<p>(322.) Let us take, for example, the question,
“What is the actual direction in which changes of
relative level are taking place between the existing
continents and seas?” If we consult partial experience,
that is, <em>all</em> the information that we possess
respecting ancient sea-marks, soundings, &amp;c., we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
shall only find ourselves bewildered in a mass of
conflicting, because imperfect, evidence. It is obvious
that the only way to decide the point is to ascertain,
by very precise and careful observations at
proper stations on coasts, selected at points where
there exist natural marks not liable to change in
the course of at least a century, the true elevation
of such marks above the <em>mean</em> level of the sea, and
to multiply these stations sufficiently over the whole
globe to be capable of affording real available knowledge.
Now, this is not a very easy operation (considering
the accuracy required); for the <em>mean</em> level
of the sea can be determined by no single observation,
any more than the mean height of the barometer
at a given station, being affected both by
periodical and accidental fluctuations due to tides,
winds, waves, and currents. Yet if an instrument
adapted for the purpose were constructed, and rendered
easily attainable, and rules for its use carefully
drawn up, there is little doubt we should soon
(by the industry of observers scattered over the
world) be in possession of a most valuable mass of
information, which could not fail to afford a point of
departure for the next generation, and furnish
ground for the only kind of argument which ever
can be conclusive on such subjects.</p>

<p>(323.) Geology, in the magnitude and sublimity
of the objects of which it treats, undoubtedly ranks,
in the scale of the sciences, next to astronomy;
like astronomy, too, its progress depends on the
continual accumulation of observations carried on
for ages. But, unlike astronomy, the observations
on which it depends, when the whole extent of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
subject to be explored is taken into consideration,
can hardly yet be said to be more than commenced.
Yet, to make up for this, there is another important
difference, that while in the latter science it is impossible
to recall the past or anticipate the future,
and observation is in consequence limited to a single
fact in a single moment; in the former, the records
of the past are always present;—they may be examined
and re-examined as often as we please, and
require nothing but diligence and judgment to put us
in possession of their whole contents. Only a very
small part of the surface of our globe has, however,
been accurately examined in detail, and of that small
portion we are only able to scratch the mere exterior,
for so we must consider those excavations
which we are apt to regard as searching the bowels
of the earth; since the deepest mines which have
been sunk penetrate to a depth hardly surpassing the
ten thousandth part of the distance between its surface
and its centre. Of course inductions founded
on such limited examination can only be regarded
as provisional, except in those remarkable cases where
the same great formations in the same order have been
recognised in very distant quarters, and without exception.
This, however, cannot long be the case. The
spirit with which the subject has been prosecuted for
many years in our own country has been rewarded
with so rich a harvest of surprising and unexpected
discoveries, and has carried the investigation of our
island into such detail, as to have excited a corresponding
spirit among our continental neighbours;
while the same zeal which animates our countrymen
on their native shore accompanies them in their sojourns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
abroad, and has already begun to supply a
fund of information respecting the geology of our
Indian possessions, as well as of every other point
where English intellect and research can penetrate.</p>

<p>(324.) Nothing can be more desirable than that
every possible facility and encouragement should be
afforded for such researches, and indeed to the pursuits
of the enlightened resident or traveller in every
department of science, by the representatives of our
national authority wherever our power extends. By
these only can our knowledge of the actual state
of the surface of the globe, and that of the animals
and vegetables of the ancient continents and seas, be
extended and perfected, while more complete information
than we at present possess of the habits of
those actually existing, and the influence of changes
of climate, food, and circumstances, on them, may
be expected to render material assistance to our
speculations respecting those which have become
extinct.</p>

</div>

<p class="center b2">OF THE EXAMINATION OF THE MATERIAL CONSTITUENTS
OF THE WORLD.</p>

<h3><i>Mineralogy.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">(325.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>he</span> consideration of the history and structure
of our globe, and the examination of the fossil
contents of its strata, lead us naturally to consider
the materials of which it consists. The history of
these materials, their properties as objects of philosophical
enquiry, and their application to the useful
arts and the embellishments of life, with the characters
by which they can be certainly distinguished
one from another, form the object of mineralogy,
taken in its most extended sense.</p>

<p>(326.) There is no branch of science which presents
so many points of contact with other departments
of physical research, and serves as a connecting
link between so many distant points of philosophical
speculation, as this. To the geologist,
the chemist, the optician, the crystallographer,
the physician, it offers especially the very elements
of their knowledge, and a field for many of
their most curious and important enquiries. Nor,
with the exception of chemistry, is there any which
has undergone more revolutions, or been exhibited
in a greater variety of forms. To the ancients it
could scarcely be said to be at all known, and up to
a comparatively recent period, nothing could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
more imperfect than its descriptions, or more inartificial
and unnatural than its classification. The
more important minerals in the arts, indeed, those
used for economical purposes and those from which
metals were extracted, had a certain degree of
attention paid to them, for the sake of their utility
and commercial value, and the precious stones for
that of ornament. But until their crystalline forms
were attentively observed and shown to be determinate
characters on which dependence could be
placed, no mineralogist could give any correct account
of the real distinction between one mineral
and another.</p>

<p>(327.) It was only, however, when chemical
analysis had acquired a certain degree of precision
and universal applicability that the importance of
mineralogy as a science began to be recognized, and
the connection between the external characters of
a stone and its ingredient constituents brought into
distinct notice. Among these characters, however,
none were found to possess that eminent distinctness
which the crystalline form offers; a character,
in the highest degree geometrical, and affording, as
might be naturally supposed, the strongest evidence
of its necessary connection with the intimate constitution
of the substance. The full importance of
this character was, however, not felt until its connection
with the texture or cleavage of a mineral
was pointed out, and even then it required numerous
and striking instances of the critical discernment of
Haüy and other eminent mineralogists in predicting
from the measurements of the angles of crystals
which had been confounded together that differences<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
would be found to exist in their chemical
composition, all which proved fully justified in their
result before the essential value of this character was
acknowledged. This was no doubt in great measure
owing to the high importance set by the German
mineralogists on those external characters of touch,
sight, weight, colour, and other sensible qualities,
which are little susceptible, with the exception of
weight, of exact determination, and which are subject
to material variations in different specimens of
the same mineral. By degrees, however, the necessity
of ascribing great weight to a character so definite
was admitted, especially when it was considered
that the same step which pointed out the intimate
connection of external form with internal structure
furnished the mineralogist with the means of reducing
all the forms of which a mineral is susceptible
under one general type, or primitive form, and afforded
grounds for an elegant theoretical account of
the assumption of definite figures <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ab initio</i>.</p>

<p>(328.) A simple and elegant invention of Dr. Wollaston,
the reflecting goniometer, gave a fresh impulse
to that view of mineralogy which makes the
crystalline form the essential or leading character,
by putting it in the power of every one, by the examination
of even the smallest portion of a broken
crystal, to ascertain and verify that essential character
on which the identity of a mineral in the
system of Haüy was made to depend. The application
of so ready and exact a method speedily led
to important results, and to a still nicer discrimination
of mineral species than could before be attained;
and the confirmation given to these results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
by chemical analysis stamped them with a scientific
and decided character which they have retained ever
since.</p>

<p>(329.) Meanwhile the progress made in chemical
analysis had led to the important conclusion that
every chemical compound susceptible of assuming
the solid state assumed with it a determinate crystalline
form; and the progress of optical science
had shown that the fundamental crystalline form, in
the case at least of transparent bodies, drew with it
a series of optical properties no less curious than important
in relation to the affections of light in its passage
through such substances. Thus, in every point
of view, additional importance became added to this
character; and the study of the crystalline forms
of bodies in general assumed the form of a separate
and independent branch of science, of which the
geometrical forms of the mineral world constituted
only a particular case. Mineralogy, however, as a
branch of natural history, remains still distinct either
from optics or crystallography. The mineralogist
is content, and thinks he has performed his task, if
not as a natural historian at least as a classifier
and arranger, if he only gives such a characteristic
description of a mineral as shall effectually distinguish
it from every other, and shall enable any one
who may encounter such a body in any part of the
world to impose on it its name, assign it a place in
his system, and turn to his books for a further description
of all that the chemist, the optician, the
lapidary, or the artist, may require to know. Still
this is no easy matter: the laborious researches of
the most eminent mineralogists can hardly yet be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
said to have effectually accomplished it; and its
difficulty may be appreciated by the small number of
simple minerals, or minerals of perfectly definite and
well-marked characters, which have been hitherto
made out. Nor can this indeed be wondered at,
when we consider that by far the greater portion
of the rocks and stones which compose the external
crust of the globe consists of nothing more than
the accumulated <em>detritus</em> of older rocks, in which the
fragments and powder of an infinite variety of substances
are mingled together, in all sorts of varying
proportions, and in such a way as to defy separation.
Many of these rocks, however, so compounded,
occur with sufficient frequency and uniformity
of character to have acquired names and to
have been usefully applied; indeed, in the latter
respect, minerals of this description far surpass all
the others. As objects of natural history, therefore,
they are well worthy of attention, however
difficult it may be to assign them a place in any
artificial arrangement.</p>

<p>(330.) This paucity of simple minerals, however,
is probably rather apparent than real, and in proportion
as the researches of the chemist and crystallographer
shall be extended throughout nature,
they will no doubt become much more numerous.
Indeed, in the great laboratories of nature it can
hardly be doubted that almost every kind of chemical
process is going forwards, by which compounds
of every description are continually forming.
Accordingly, it is remarked, that the lavas and
ejected scoriæ of volcanoes are receptacles in which
mineral products previously unknown are constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
discovered, and that the primitive formations, as
they are called in geology, which bear no marks of
having been produced by the destruction of others,
are also remarkable for the beauty and distinctness
of character of their minerals.</p>

<p>(331.) The great difficulty which has been experienced
in attempts to classify mineral substances
by their chemical constituents has arisen from the
observed presence, in some specimens of minerals
bearing that general resemblance in other respects
as well as agreement in form which would seem to
entitle them to be considered as alike, of ingredients
foreign to the usual composition of the species, and
that occasionally in so large a proportion as to render
it unjustifiable to refer their occurrence to accidental
impurities. These cases, as well as some
anomalies observed in the classification of minerals
by their crystalline forms, which seemed to show
that the same substance might occasionally appear
under two distinct forms, as well as some remarkable
coincidences between the forms of substances
quite distinct from each other in a chemical point of
view, have within a recent period given rise to a
branch of the science of crystallography of a very
curious and important nature. The <em>isomorphism</em>
of certain groups of chemical elements has already
afforded us an example illustrative of the manner in
which inductions sometimes receive unexpected
verifications (see <a href="#p180">180</a>.). The laws and relations
thus brought to light are among the most curious
and interesting parts of modern science, and
seem likely in their further developement to afford
ample scope for the exercise of chemical and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
mineralogical research. They have already afforded
innumerable fine examples of that important step in
science by which anomalies disappear, and occasional
incongruities become reconciled under more general
expressions of physical laws, and thus unite in
affording support to those very views which they promised,
when first observed, to overset. Nothing, indeed,
can be more striking than to see the very ingredient
which every previous chemist and mineralogist
would agree to disregard and reject as a mere
casual impurity brought forward and appealed to in
support of a theory expressly directed to the object
of rescuing science from the imputation of disregarding,
under any circumstances, the plain results
of direct experiment.</p>

<h3><i>Chemistry.</i></h3>

<p>(332.) The laws which concern the intimate constitution
of bodies, not as respects their <em>structure</em> or
the manner in which their parts are put together,
but as regards their <em>materials</em> or the ingredients of
which those parts are composed, form the objects of
chemistry. A solid body may be regarded as a
fabric, more or less regularly and artificially constructed,
in which the materials and the workmanship
may be separately considered, and in which,
though the latter be ruined and confounded by
violence, the former remain unchanged in their
nature, though differently arranged. In liquid or
aërial bodies, too, though there prevails a less
degree of difference in point of structure, and a
greater facility of dispersion and dissipation, than in
solids, yet an equal diversity of <em>materials</em> subsists,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
giving to them properties differing extremely from
each other.</p>

<p>(333.) The inherent activity of matter is proved
not only by the production of motion by the mutual
attractions and repulsions of distant or contiguous
masses, but by the changes and apparent transformations
which different substances undergo in
their sensible qualities by mere mixture. If water
be added to water, or salt to salt, the effect is an
increase of quantity, but no change of quality. In this
case, the mutual action of the particles is entirely mechanical.
Again, if a blue powder and a yellow one,
each perfectly dry, be mixed and well shaken together,
a green powder will be produced; but this is a mere
effect arising in the eye from the intimate mixture
of the yellow and blue light separately and independently
reflected from the minute particles of
each; and the proof is had by examining the mixture
with a microscope, when the yellow and blue
grains will be seen separate and each quite unaltered.
If the same experiment be tried with coloured
liquids, which are susceptible of mixing without
chemical action, a compound colour is likewise produced,
but no examination with magnifiers is in that
case sufficient to detect the ingredients; the reason
obviously being, the excessive minuteness of the
parts, and their perfect intermixture, produced by
agitating two liquids together. From the mixture
of two powders, extreme patience would enable any
one, by picking out with a magnifier grain after grain,
to separate the ingredients. But when liquids are
mixed, no mechanical separation is any longer practicable;
the particles are so minute as to elude all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
search. Yet this does not hinder us from regarding
such a compound as still a mere mixture, and its
properties are accordingly intermediate between
those of the liquids mixed. But this is far from
being the case with all liquids. When a solution of
potash, for example, and another of tartaric acid,
each perfectly liquid, are mixed together in proper
proportions, a great quantity of a solid saline substance
falls to the bottom of the containing vessel,
which is quite different from either potash or tartaric
acid, and the liquid from which it subsided
offers no indications by its taste or other sensible
qualities of the ingredients mixed, but of something
totally different from either. It is evident that this
is a phenomenon widely different from that of mere
mixture; there has taken place a great and radical
change in the intimate nature of the ingredients, by
which a new substance is produced which had no
existence before. And it has been produced by the
<em>union</em> of the ingredients presented to each other; for
when examined it is found that nothing has been
<em>lost</em>, the weight of the whole mixture being the
sum of the weights mixed. Yet the potash and
tartaric acid have disappeared entirely, and the
weight of the new product is found to be exactly
equal to that of the tartaric acid and potash employed,
taken together, abating a small portion held
in solution in the liquid, which may be obtained
however by evaporation. They have therefore combined,
and adhere to one another with a cohesive
force sufficient to form a solid out of a liquid; a force
which has thus been called into action by merely
presenting them to each other in a state of solution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
(334.) It is the business of chemistry to investigate
these and similar changes, or the reverse of such
changes, where a single substance is resolved into
two or more others, having different properties from
it, and from each other, and to enquire into all the
circumstances which can influence them; and either
determine, modify, or suspend their accomplishment,
whether such influence be exercised by heat
or cold, by time and rest, or by agitation or pressure,
or by any of those agents of which we have
acquired a knowledge, such as electricity, light,
magnetism, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(335.) The wonderful and sudden transformations
with which chemistry is conversant, the violent activity
often assumed by substances usually considered
the most inert and sluggish, and, above all, the insight
it gives into the nature of innumerable operations
which we see daily carried on around us, have contributed
to render it the most popular, as it is one of
the most extensively useful, of the sciences; and we
shall, accordingly, find none which have sprung
forward, during the last century, with such extraordinary
vigour, and have had such extensive influence
in promoting corresponding progress in
others. One of the chief causes of its popularity is,
perhaps, to be sought for in this, that it is, of all the
sciences, perhaps, the most completely an experimental
one; and even its theories are, for the
most part, of that generally intelligible and readily
applicable kind, which demand no intense concentration
of thought, and lead to no profound mathematical
researches. The simple process of inductive
generalization, grounded on the examination of numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
facts, all of them presenting considerable
intrinsic interest, has sufficed, in most instances, to
lead, by a clear and direct road, to its highest laws
yet known. But, on the other hand, these laws,
when stated, are not yet fully sufficient to lead us,
except in very limited cases, to a deductive knowledge
of particulars never before examined, at least,
not without great caution, and constant appeal to
experiment as a check on our reasoning; so that we
are justified in regarding the <em>axioms</em> of chemistry,
the true handles of deductive reasoning, as still unknown,
and, perhaps, likely long to remain so. This
is no fault of its cultivators, who have comprised in
their list the highest and most varied talents and
industry, but of the inherent complexity of the
subject, and the infinite multitude of causes which
are concerned in the production of every, even the
simplest, chemical phenomenon.</p>

<p>(336.) The history of chemistry (on which, however,
we are not about to enlarge,) is one of great interest
to those who delight to trace the steps by which
mankind advance to the discovery of truth through
a series of mistakes and failures. It may be divided,
1st, into the period of the alchemists, a lamentable
epoch in the annals of intellectual wandering; 2dly,
that of the phlogistic doctrines of Beccher and Stahl,
in which, as if to prove the perversity of the human
mind, of two possible roads the wrong was chosen;
and a theory obtained universal credence on the
strength of an induction, valid as such, but wrongly
interpreted, which is negatived, <em>in every instance</em>,
by an appeal to the balance. This, too, happened,
not by reason of unlucky coincidences, or individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
oversights, but of necessity, and from an inherent
defect of the theory itself, which thus impeded the
progress of the science, as far as a science of experiment
can be impeded by a false theory, by perplexing
its cultivators with the appearance of
contradictions in their experiments where none
really subsisted, by destroying all their confidence
in the numerical exactness of their own results,
and by involving the subject in a mist of visionary
and hypothetical causes in place of the true
acting principles. Thus, in the combustion of any
substance which is incapable of flying away in fumes,
an increase of weight takes place,—the ashes are
heavier than the fuel. Whenever this was observed,
however, it was passed carelessly over as arising
from the escape of phlogiston, or the principle of inflammability,
which was considered as being either
the element of fire itself, or in some way combined
with it, and thus essentially <em>light</em>. It is now known
that the increase of weight is owing to the absorption
of, and combination with, a quantity of a peculiar
ingredient called <em>oxygen</em>, from the air, a principle
essentially <em>heavy</em>. So far as weight is concerned, it
makes no difference whether a body having weight
enters, or one having levity escapes; but there is
this plain difference in a philosophical point of view,
that oxygen is a real producible substance, and
phlogiston is no such thing: the former is a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera
causa</i>, the latter an hypothetical being, introduced
to account for what the other accounts for much
better.</p>

<p>(337.) The third age of chemistry—that which
may be called emphatically modern chemistry—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>commenced
(in 1786) when Lavoisier, by a series of
memorable experiments, extinguished for ever this
error, and placed chemistry in the rank of one of the
exact sciences,—a science of number, weight, and
measure. From that epoch to the present day it has
constantly advanced with an accelerated progress,
and at this moment may be regarded as more progressive
than ever. The principal features in this
progress may be comprised under the following
general <span class="locked">heads:—</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p> 1. The discovery of the proximate, if not the
ultimate, elements of all bodies, and the enlargement
of the list of known elements to
its present extent of between fifty and sixty
substances.</p>

<p> 2. The developement of the doctrine of latent
heat by Black, with its train of important
consequences, including the scientific theory
of the steam-engine.</p>

<p> 3. The establishment of Wenzel’s law of definite
proportions on his own experiments, and
those of Richter, a discovery subsequently
merged in the more general wording and
better development of Dalton’s atomic
theory.</p>

<p> 4. The precise determination of the atomic weights
of the different chemical elements, mainly
due to the astonishing industry of Berzelius,
and his unrivalled command of chemical resources,
as well as to the researches of the
other chemists of the Swedish and German
school.</p>

<p> 5. The assimilation of gases and vapours, by which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
we are led to regard the former, universally,
as particular cases of the latter, a generalization
resulting chiefly from the experiments
of Faraday on the condensation of the gases,
and those of Gay-Lussac and Dalton, on the

<p>(338.) To pursue these several heads into detail
would lead us into a treatise on chemistry; but a
few remarks on one or two of them, as they bear
upon the general principles of all scientific enquiry,
will not be irrelevant. And first, then, with reference
to the discovery of new elements, it will be
observed, that philosophical chemistry no more aims
at determining the one essential element out of which
all matter is framed—the one ultimate principle of
the universe—than astronomy at discovering the
origin of the planetary movements in the application
of a determinate projectile force in a determinate
direction, or geology at ascending to the creation
of the earth. There may be such an element. Some
singular relations which have been pointed out in
the atomic weights of bodies seem to suggest to
minds fond of speculation that there is; but philosophical
chemistry is content to wait for some striking
fact, which may either occur unexpectedly or be led
to by the slow progress of enlarged views, to disclose
to us its existence. Still, the multiplication of so-considered
elementary bodies has been considered
by some as an inconvenience. We confess we do
not coincide with this view. Whatever they be, the
obstinacy with which they resist decomposition
shows that they are ingredients of a very high and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
primary importance in the economy of nature; and
such as, in any state of science, it would be indispensably
necessary to be perfectly familiar with.
Like particular theorems in geometry, which,
though not rising to the highest point of generality,
have yet their several scopes and ranges of extensive
application, they must be well and perfectly
understood in all their bearings. Should we ever
arrive at an analysis of these bodies, the chemical
properties of the new elements which will then
come into view will be known only by our knowledge
of these, or of other compounds of the same
class, which they may be capable of forming. Not but
that such an analysis would be a most important and
indeed triumphant achievement, and change the
face of chemistry; but it would undo nothing that
has been done, and render useless no point of knowledge
which we have yet arrived at.</p>

<p>(339.) The atomic theory, or the law of definite
proportions, which is the same thing presented in a
form divested of all hypothesis, after the laws of
mechanics, is, perhaps, the most important which
the study of nature has yet disclosed. The extreme
simplicity which characterizes it, and which is
itself an indication, not unequivocal, of its elevated
rank in the scale of physical truths, had the effect
of causing it to be announced at once by Mr.
Dalton, in its most general terms, on the contemplation
of a few instances<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>, without passing through
subordinate stages of painful inductive ascent by
the intermedium of subordinate laws, such as, had
the contrary course been pursued by him, would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
have been naturally preparatory to it, and such as
would have led others to it by the prosecution of
Wenzel’s and Richter’s researches, had they been
duly attended to. This is, in fact, an example, and
a most remarkable one, of the effect of that natural
propensity to generalize and simplify (noticed in
171.), which, if it occasionally leads to over-hasty
conclusions, limited or disproved by further experience,
is yet the legitimate parent of many of our
most valuable and soundest results. Instances like
this, where great and, indeed, immeasurable steps
in our knowledge of nature are made at once, and
almost without intellectual effort, are well calculated
to raise our hopes of the future progress of science,
and, by pointing out the simplest and most obvious
combinations as those which are actually found to
be agreeable to the harmony of creation, to hold
out the cheering prospect of difficulties diminishing
as we advance, instead of thickening around us in
increasing complexity.</p>

<p>(340.) A consequence of this immediate presentation
of the law of definite proportions in its most
general form is, that its subordinate laws—those
which limit its generality in particular cases, which
diminish the number of combinations abstractly
possible, and restrain the indiscriminate mixture of
elements,—remain to be discovered. Some such
limitations have, in fact, been traced to a certain
extent, but by no means so far as the importance of
the subject requires; and we have here abundant
occupation for chemists for some time.</p>

<p>(341.) The determination of the atomic weights
of the chemical elements, like that of other standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
physical data, with the utmost exactness, is in itself
a branch of enquiry not only of the greatest importance,
but of extreme difficulty. Independent
of the general reasons for desiring accuracy in this
respect, there is one peculiar to the subject. It
has been suggested (by Dr. Prout), and strongly
insisted on (by Dr. Thomson), that all the numbers
representing these weights, constituting a scale of
great extent, in which the extremes already known
are in proportion to each other, as 1 to upwards of
200, are simple even multiples of the least of them.
If this be really the case, it opens views of such
importance as to justify any degree of labour and
pains in the verification of the law as a purely inductive
one. But in the actual state of chemical
analysis, with all deference to such high authority,
we confess it appears to us to stand in great need
of further confirmation, since it seems doubtful
whether such accuracy has yet been attained as to
enable us to answer positively for a fraction not
exceeding the three or four hundredth part of the
whole quantity to be determined: at least the results
of the first experimenters, obtained with the
greatest care, differ often by a greater amount; and
this degree of exactness, at least, would be required
to verify the law satisfactorily in the higher parts
of the scale.</p>

<p>(342.) The mere agitation of such a question,
however, points out a class of phenomena in physical
science of a remote and singular kind, and of a very
high and refined order, which could never become
known but in an advanced state of science, not only
practical, but theoretical,—we mean, such as consist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
in observed relations among the <em>data</em> of physics,
which show them to be quantities not <em>arbitrarily</em>
assumed, but depending on laws and causes which
they may be the means of at length disclosing.
A remarkable instance of such a relation is the
curious law which Bode observed to obtain in the
progression of the magnitudes of the several planetary
orbits. This law was interrupted between Mars
and Jupiter, so as to induce him to consider a
planet as wanting in that interval;—a deficiency
long afterwards strangely supplied by the discovery
of <em>four</em> new planets in that very interval, all of
whose orbits conform in dimension to the law in
question, within such moderate limits of error as
may be due to causes independent of those on which
the law itself ultimately rests.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>(343.) Neither is it irrelevant to our subject to
remark, that the progress which has been made in
this department of chemistry, and the considerable
exactness actually attainable in chemical analysis,
have been owing, in great measure, to a circumstance
which might at first have been hardly considered
likely to exercise much influence on the
progress of a science,—the discovery of platina.
Without the resources placed at the ready disposal
of chemists by this invaluable metal, it is difficult to
conceive that the multitude of delicate analytical
experiments which have been required to construct
the fabric of existing knowledge could have ever
been performed. This, among many such lessons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
will teach us that the most important uses of natural
objects are not those which offer themselves
to us most obviously. The chief use of the moon
for man’s immediate purposes remained unknown
to him for five thousand years from his creation.
And, since it cannot but be that innumerable and
most important uses remain to be discovered among
the materials and objects already known to us, as
well as among those which the progress of science
must hereafter disclose, we may hence conceive a
well-grounded expectation, not only of constant increase
in the physical resources of mankind, and the
consequent improvement of their condition, but of
continual accessions to our power of penetrating
into the arcana of nature, and becoming acquainted
with her highest laws.</p>

<h3><i>Heat.</i></h3>

<p class="in0">(344.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">O</span>ne</span> of the chief agents in chemistry, on
whose proper application and management the
success of a great number of its enquiries depends,
and many of whose most important laws are disclosed
to us by phenomena of a chemical nature,
is <span class="smcap smaller">HEAT</span>. Although some of its effects are continually
before our eyes as matters of the most
common occurrence, insomuch that there is scarcely
any process in the useful arts and manufactures
which does not call for its intervention, and although,
independent of this high utility, and the
proportionate importance of a knowledge of its
nature and laws, it presents in itself a subject of
the most curious speculation; yet there is scarcely
any physical agent of which we have so imperfect
a knowledge, whose intimate nature is more hidden,
or whose laws are of such delicate and difficult investigation.</p>

<p>(345.) The word heat generally implies the sensation
which we experience on approaching a fire;
but, in the sense it carries in physics, it denotes the
cause, whatever it be, of that sensation, and of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
the other phenomena which arise on the application
of fire, or of any other heating cause. We should
be greatly deceived if we referred only to sensation
as an indication of the presence of this cause.
Many of those things which excite in our organs,
and especially of those of taste, a sensation of heat,
owe this property to chemical stimulants, and not
at all to their being actually <em>hot</em>. This error of
judgment has produced a corresponding confusion
of language, and hence had actually at one period<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
crept into physical philosophy a great many illogical
and absurd conclusions. Again, there are a number
of chemical agents, which, from their corroding,
blackening, and dissolving, or drying up the parts
of some descriptions of bodies, and producing on
them effects not generally unlike (though intrinsically
very different from) those produced by heat,
are said, in loose and vulgar language, to burn
them; and this error has even become rooted into
a prejudice, by the fact that some of these agents
are capable of becoming actually and truly <em>hot</em>
during their action on moist substances, by reason
of their combination with the water the latter contain.
Thus, quicklime and oil of vitriol both exercise
a powerful corrosive action on animal and
vegetable substances, and both become violently
hot by their combination with water. They are,
therefore, set down in vulgar parlance as substances
of a hot nature; whereas, in their relations to the
physical cause of heat, they agree with the generality
of bodies similarly constituted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
(346.) The nature of heat has hitherto been
chiefly studied under the general heads <span class="locked">of—</span></p>

<blockquote class="hang2">

<p>1st, Its sources, or the phenomena which it usually
accompanies.</p>

<p>2d, Its communication from its sources to substances
capable of receiving it, and from these
to others, with a view to discover the laws
which regulate its distribution through space
or through the bodies which occupy it.</p>

<p>3d, Its effects, on our senses, and on the bodies to
which it is communicated in its various degrees
of intensity, by which, means are afforded
us of measuring these degrees.</p>

<p>4th, Its intimate relations to the atoms of matter,
as exhibited in its capability of acquiring a
latent state under certain circumstances, and
of entering into something like chemical combinations.</p></blockquote>

<p>(347.) The most obvious sources of heat are, the
sun, fire, animal life, fermentations, violent chemical
actions of all kinds, friction, percussion, lightning,
or the electric discharge, in whatever manner produced,
the sudden condensation of air, and others,
so numerous, and so varied, as to show the extensive
and important part it has to perform in the
economy of nature. The discoveries of chemists,
however, have referred most of these to the general
head of chemical combination. Thus, fire, or the
combustion of inflammable bodies, is nothing more
than a violent chemical action attending the combination
of their ingredients with the oxygen of the
air. Animal heat is, in like manner, referable to a
process bearing no remote analogy to a slow combustion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
by which a portion of carbon, an inflammable
principle existing in the blood, is united with
the oxygen of the air in respiration; and thus carried
off from the system: fermentation is nothing
more than a decomposition of chemical elements
loosely united, and their re-union in a more permanent
state of combination. The analogy between
the sun and terrestrial fire is so natural as to have
been chosen by Newton to exemplify the irresistible
force of an inference derived from that principle.
But the nature of the sun and the mode in which
its wonderful supply of light and heat is maintained
are involved in a mystery which every discovery that
has been made either in chemistry or optics, so far
from elucidating, seems only to render more profound.
Friction as a source of heat is well known:
we rub our hands to warm them, and we grease
the axles of carriage-wheels to prevent their setting
fire to the wood; an accident which, in spite of
this precaution, does sometimes happen. But the
effect of friction, as a means of producing heat with
little or no consumption of materials, was not fully
understood till made the subject of direct experiment
by count Rumford, whose results appear to
have established the extraordinary fact, that an
unlimited supply of heat may be derived by friction
from the same materials. Condensation, whether
of air by pressure, or of metals by percussion, is
another powerful source of heat. Thus, iron may
be so dexterously hammered as to become red-hot,
and the rapid condensation of a confined portion of
air will set tinder on fire.</p>

<p>(348.) The most violent heats known are produced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
by the concentration of the solar rays by
burning glasses,—by the combustion of oxygen and
hydrogen gases mixed in the exact proportion in
which they combine to produce water,—and by the
discharge of a continued and copious current of
electricity through a small conductor. As these
three sources of heat are independent of each
other, and each capable of being brought into
action in a very confined space, there seems no
reason why they might not all three be applied at
once at the same point, by which means, probably,
effects would be produced infinitely surpassing any
hitherto witnessed.</p>

<p>(349.) Heat is communicated either by <em>radiation</em>
between bodies at a distance, or by <em>conduction</em>
between bodies in contact, or between the contiguous
parts of one and the same body. The laws
of the radiation of heat have been studied with
great attention, and have been found to present
strong analogies with that of light in some points,
and singular differences in others. Thus, the heat
which accompanies the sun’s rays comports itself,
in all respects, like light; being subject to similar
laws of reflection, refraction, and even of polarization,
as has been shown by Berard. Yet they are
not identical with each other; Sir William Herschel
having shown, by decisive experiments, verified by
those of Sir H. Englefield, that there exist in a
solar beam both rays of heat which are not luminous,
and rays of light which have no heating power.</p>

<p>(350.) The heat, radiated by terrestrial fires, and
by bodies <em>obscurely</em> hot, by whatever means they
have acquired their heat (even by exposure to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
sun’s rays), differs very materially from solar heat
in their power of penetrating transparent substances.
This singular and important difference was first
noticed by Mariotte, and afterwards made the subject
of many curious and interesting experiments
by Scheele, who found that terrestrial heat, or that
radiated from fires or heated bodies, is intercepted
and detained by glass or other transparent bodies,
while solar heat is not; and that, being so detained,
it heats them: which the latter, as it passes freely
through them, is incapable of doing. The more
recent researches of Delaroche, however, have
shown that this detention is complete only when
the temperature of the source of heat is low; but
that, as that temperature is higher, a portion of the
heat radiated acquires a power of penetrating glass;
and that the quantity which does so bears continually
a larger and larger proportion to the whole,
as the heat of the radiant body is more intense.
This discovery is very important, as it establishes
a community of nature between solar and terrestrial
heat; while at the same time it leads us to regard
the actual temperature of the sun as far exceeding
that of any earthly flame.</p>

<p>(351.) A variety of theories have been framed to
account for these curious phenomena; but the subject
stands rather in need of further elucidation
from experiment, and is one which merits, and will
probably amply repay, the labours of those who may
hereafter devote their attention to it. The theory
of the radiation of heat, in general, which seems to
agree best with the known phenomena, is that of
M. Prevost, who considers all bodies as constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
radiating out heat in all directions, and receiving it
by a similar means of communication from others,
and thus tending, in any space filled, wholly or in
part, with bodies at various temperatures, to establish
an equilibrium or equality of heat in all parts.
The application of this idea to the explanation of
the phenomenon of dew we have already seen (see
<a href="#p167">167</a>.). The laws of such radiation, under various
circumstances, have been lately investigated in a
beautiful series of experiments on the cooling of
bodies by their own radiation in vacuo, by Messrs.
Dulong and Petit, which offer some of the best examples
in science of the inductive investigation of
quantitative laws.</p>

<p>(352.) The communication of heat between bodies
in contact, or between the different parts of the
same body, is performed by a process called conduction.
It is, in fact, only a particular case of
radiation, as has been explained above (217.); but
a case <em>so</em> particular as to require a separate and
independent investigation of its laws. The most
important consideration introduced into the enquiry
by this peculiarity is that of time. The communication
of heat by conduction is performed, for
the most part, with extreme slowness, while that
performed by direct radiation is probably not less
rapid than the propagation of light itself. The
analysis of the delicate and difficult points which
arise in the investigation of this subject in its
reduction to direct geometrical treatment has been
executed with admirable success by the late Baron
Fourrier, whose recent lamented death has deprived
science of an ornament it could ill spare, thinned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
as its ranks have been within the last few years.
This acute philosopher and profound mathematician
has developed, in a series of elaborate
memoirs presented to the French Institute, the
laws of the communication of heat through the
interior of solid masses, placed under the influence
of any external heating and cooling causes, and has
in particular applied his results to the conditions on
which the maintenance of the actual observed
temperature on the earth’s surface depends; to the
possible influence of a supposed central heat on our
climates; and to the determination of the actual
amount of the heat, derived to us from the sun, or
at least that portion of it on which the difference of
the seasons depends.</p>

<p>(353.) The principal effects of heat are the sensations
of warmth or cold consequent on its entry
or egress into or out of our bodies; the dilatation it
causes in the dimensions of all substances in which
it is accumulated; the changes of state it produces
in the melting of solids, and the conversion of
them and of liquids into vapour; and the chemical
changes it performs by actual decompositions
effected in the intimate molecules of various substances,
especially those of which vegetables and
animals are composed; to which we may add, the
production of electric phenomena under certain
circumstances in the contact of metals, and the
developement of electric polarity in crystallised substances.</p>

<p>(354.) Cold has been considered by some as a
positive quality, the effect of a cause antagonist to
that of heat; but this idea seems now (with perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
a single exception) to be universally abandoned.
The sensation of cold is as easily explicable by the
passage of heat outwards through the surface of the
body as that of heat by its ingress from without;
and the experiments cited in proof of a radiation of
cold are all perfectly explained by Prevost’s theory
of reciprocal interchange. It is remarkable, however,
how very limited our means of producing intense
cold are, compared with those we possess of
effecting the accumulation of heat in bodies. This
is one of the strongest arguments adducible in favour
of the doctrines of those who maintain the possibility
of exhausting the heat of a body altogether, and
leaving it in a state absolutely devoid of it. But we
ought to consider, that the known methods of generating
heat chiefly turn on the production of chemical
combinations: we may easily conceive, therefore,
that, to obtain equally powerful corresponding
frigorific effects, we ought to possess the means of
effecting a disunion equally extensive and rapid between
such elements, actually combined, as have
already produced heat by their union. This, however,
we can only accomplish by engaging them in
combinations still more energetic, that is to say, in
which we may reasonably expect more heat to be
produced by the new combination than would be
destroyed or abstracted by the proposed decomposition.
Chemistry, however, (unaided by electric
agency,) affords no means of suddenly breaking the
union of two elements, and presenting <em>both</em> in an uncombined
state. A certain analogy to such disunion,
however, and its consequences, may be traced in the
sudden expansion of condensed gases from a liquid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
state into vapour, which is the most powerful source
of cold known.</p>

<p>(355.) The dilatation of bodies by heat forms the
subject of that branch of science called pyrometry.
There is no body but is capable of being penetrated
by heat, though some with greater, others with less
rapidity; and being so penetrated, all bodies (with a
very few exceptions, and those depending on very peculiar
circumstances,) are dilated by it in bulk, though
with a great diversity in the amount of dilatation
produced by the same degree of heat. Of the several
forms of natural bodies, gases and vapours are observed
to be most dilatable; liquids next, and solids
least of all. The dilatation of solids has been made
a subject of repeated and careful measurement by
several experimenters; among whom, Smeaton,
Lavoisier, and Laplace, are the principal. The
remarkable discovery of the unequal dilatation of
crystallised bodies by Mitscherlich has already
been spoken of. (266.) That of gases and vapours
was examined about the same time by Dalton and
Gay-Lussac, who both arrived independently at the
conclusion of an equal dilatability subsisting in
them all, which constitutes one of the most remarkable
points in their history.</p>

<p>(356.) The dilatation of air by heat affords, perhaps,
the most unexceptionable means known of
measuring degrees of heat. The thermometer, as
originally constructed by Cornelius Drebell, was an
air thermometer. Those now in common use
measure accessions of heat not by the degree of
dilatation of air but of mercury. It has been shown,
by the researches of Dulong and Petit, that its indications<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
coincide exactly with that of the air-thermometer
in moderate temperatures; though at very
elevated ones they exhibit a sensible, and even
considerable, deviation. By this instrument, which
owes its present convenience and utility to the
happy idea of Newton, who first thought of fixing
determinate points on its scale, we are enabled to
estimate, or at least identify, the degrees of heat;
and thereby to investigate with accuracy the laws
of its communication and its other properties. Were
we sure that equal additions of heat produced equal
increments of dimension in any substance, the indications
of a thermometer would afford a true and
secure <em>measure</em> of the quantity present; but this is
so far from being the case, that we are nearly in
total ignorance on this important point; a circumstance
which throws the greatest difficulty in the way
of all theoretical reasoning, and even of experimental
enquiry. The laws of the dilatation of liquids,
in consequence of this deficiency of necessary preliminary
knowledge, are still involved in great obscurity,
notwithstanding the pains which have been
bestowed on them by the elaborate experiments and
calculations of Gilpin, Blagden, Deluc, Dalton, Gay-Lussac,
and Biot.</p>

<p>(357.) The most striking and important of the
effects of heat consist, however, in the liquefaction of
solid substances, and the conversion of the liquids
so produced into vapour. There is no solid substance
known which, by a sufficiently intense heat, may
not be melted, and finally dissipated in vapour; and
this analogy is so extensive and cogent, that we cannot
but suppose that all those bodies which are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
liquid under ordinary circumstances, owe their liquidity
to heat, and would freeze or become solid if
their heat could be sufficiently reduced. In many
we see this to be the case in ordinary winters; for
some, severe frosts are requisite; others freeze only
with the most intense artificial colds; and some
have hitherto resisted all our endeavours; yet the
number of these last is few, and they will probably
cease to be exceptions as our means of producing
cold become enlarged.</p>

<p>(358.) A similar analogy leads us to conclude that
all aëriform fluids are merely liquids kept in the
state of vapour by heat. Many of them have been
actually condensed into the liquid state by cold accompanied
with violent pressure; and as our means
of applying these causes of condensation have improved,
more and more refractory ones have successively
yielded. Hence we are fairly entitled to
extend our conclusion to those which we have not
yet been able to succeed with; and thus we are led
to regard it as a general fact, that the liquid and
aëriform or vaporous states are entirely dependent
on <em>heat</em>; that were it not for this cause, there
would be nothing but solids in nature; and that, on
the other hand, nothing but a sufficient intensity of
heat is requisite to destroy the cohesion of every
substance, and reduce all bodies, first to liquids, and
then into vapour.</p>

<p>(359.) But solids, themselves, by the abstraction
of heat shrink in dimension, and at the same time
become harder, and more brittle; yielding less to
pressure, and permitting less separation between
their parts by tension. These facts, coupled with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
the greater compressibility of liquids, and the still
greater of gases, strongly induce us to believe that
it is heat, and heat alone, which holds the particles
of all bodies at that distance from each other which
is necessary to allow of compression; which in fact
gives them their elasticity, and acts as the antagonist
force to their mutual attraction, which would
otherwise draw them into actual contact, and retain
them in a state of absolute immobility and impenetrability.
Thus we learn to regard heat as one of
the great maintaining powers of the universe, and to
attach to all its laws and relations a degree of importance
which may justly entitle them to the most
assiduous enquiry.</p>

<p>(360.) It was first ascertained by Dr. Black that
when heat produces the liquefaction of a solid, or
the conversion of a liquid into vapour, the liquid or
the vapour resulting is no <em>hotter</em> than the solid or
liquid from which it was produced, though a great
deal of heat has been expended in producing this
effect, and has actually entered into the substance.</p>

<p>(361.) Hence he drew the conclusion that it has
become <em>latent</em>, and continues to exist in the product,
maintaining it in its new state, without increasing
its temperature. He further proved, that when the
vapour condenses, or the liquid freezes, this latent
heat is again given out from it. This great discovery,
with its natural and hardly less important
concomitant, that of the difference of specific heats
in different bodies, or the different quantities of heat
they require to raise their temperature equally, are
the chief reasons for regarding heat as a material
substance in a more decided manner than light,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
with which in its radiant state it holds so close an
analogy.</p>

<p>(362.) The subject of latent heat has been far less
attentively studied than its great practical importance
would appear to demand, when we consider
that it is to this part of physical science that the
theory of the steam-engine is mainly referable, and
that material improvements may not unreasonably
be expected in that wonderful instrument, from a
more extended knowledge than we possess of the
latent heats of different vapours. This is not the
case, however, with the subject of specific heat,
which was followed up immediately after its first
promulgation with diligence by Irvine; and, after a
brief interval, by Lavoisier and Laplace, as well as
by our countryman Crawfurd, who determined the
specific heats of many substances, both solid and
liquid. After a considerable period of inactivity, the
subject was again resumed by Delaroche and Berard,
and subsequently by Dulong and Petit: the result of
whose investigations has been the inductive establishment
of one of those simple and elegant physical
laws which carry with them, if not their own
evidence, at least their own recommendation to our
belief, as being in unison with every thing we know
of the harmony of nature. The law to which we
allude is this:—that the atoms of all the simple
chemical elements have exactly the same capacity
for heat, or are all equally heated or cooled by equal
accessions or abstractions of heat. It is only among
laws like this that we can expect to find a clew capable
of guiding us to a knowledge of the true nature
of heat, and its relations to ponderable matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Magnetism and Electricity.</i></h3>

<p>(363.) These two subjects, which had long maintained
a distinct existence, and been studied as
separate branches of science, are at length effectually
blended. This is, perhaps, the most satisfactory
result which the experimental sciences have ever
yet attained. All the phenomena of magnetic polarity,
attraction, and repulsion, have at length been
resolved into one general fact, that two currents of
electricity, moving in the same direction repel, and
in contrary directions attract, each other. The
phenomena of the communication of magnetism and
what is called its induced state, alone remain unaccounted
for; but the interesting theory which has
been developed by M. Ampere, under the name of
Electro-dynamics, holds out a hope that this difficulty
will also in its turn give way, and the whole
subject be at length completely merged, as far as the
consideration of the acting causes goes, in the more
general one of electricity. This, however, does not
prevent magnetism from maintaining its separate
importance as a department of physical enquiry,
having its own peculiar laws and relations of the
highest practical interest, which are capable of
being studied quite apart from all consideration of its
electrical origin. And not only so, but to study them
with advantage, we must proceed as if that origin
were totally unknown, and, at least up to a certain
point, and that a considerably advanced one, conduct
our enquiries into the subject on the same inductive
principles as if this branch of physics were absolutely
independent of all others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
(364.) Iron, and its oxides and alloys, were for a
long time the only substances considered susceptible
of magnetism. The loadstone was even one of the
examples produced by Bacon of that class of physical
instances to which he applies the term “Instantiæ
monodicæ”—<em>singular instances</em>. And the
history of magnetism affords a beautiful comment on
his remark on instances of this sort. “Nor should
our enquiries,” he observes, “into their nature be
broken off, till the properties and qualities found in
such things as may be esteemed wonders in nature
are reduced and comprehended under some certain
law; so that all irregularity or singularity may be
found to depend upon some common form, and the
wonder only rest in the exact differences, degrees,
or extraordinary concurrence, and not in the species
itself.” The discovery of the magnetism of nickel,
which though inferior to that of iron, is still considerable;
that of cobalt, yet feebler, and that of
titanium, which is only barely perceptible, have
effectually broken down the imaginary limit between
iron and the other materials of the world, and established
the existence of that general law of continuity
which it is one chief business of philosophy
to trace throughout nature. The more recent discoveries
of M. Arago (mentioned in 160.) have
completed this generalization, by showing that there
is no substance but which, under proper circumstances,
is capable of exhibiting unequivocal signs of
the magnetic virtue. And to obliterate all traces of
that line of separation which was once so broad, we
are now enabled, by the great discovery of Oërsted,
to communicate at and during pleasure to a coiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
wire of any metal indifferently all the properties of
a magnet;—its attraction, repulsion, and polarity;
and <em>that</em> even in a more intense degree than was previously
thought to be possible in the best natural
magnets. In short, in this case, and in this case
only, perhaps, in science, have we arrived at that
point which Bacon seems to have understood by the
discovery of “forms.” “The <em>form</em> of any nature,”
says he, “is such, that where it is, the given nature
must infallibly be. The form, therefore, is perpetually
present when that nature is present; ascertains
it universally, and accompanies it every where.
Again, this form is such, that when removed, the
given nature infallibly vanishes. Lastly, a true form
is such as can deduce a given nature from some
essential property, which resides in many things.”</p>

<p>(365.) Magnetism is remarkable in another important
point of view. It offers a prominent, or
“<em>glaring instance</em>” of that quality in nature which
is termed <em>polarity</em> (267.), and that under circumstances
which peculiarly adapt it for the study of
this quality. It does not appear that the ancients
had any knowledge of this property of the magnet,
though its attraction of iron was well known to them.
The first mention of it in modern times cannot be
traced earlier than 1180, though it was probably
known to the Chinese before that time. The polarity
of the magnet consists in this, that if suspended
freely, one part of it will invariably direct
itself towards a certain point in the horizon, the
other towards the opposite point; and that, if two
magnets, so suspended, be brought near each other,
there will take place a mutual action, in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of which, the positions of both will be disturbed, in
the same manner as would happen if the corresponding
parts of each repelled, and those oppositely
directed attracted, each other; and by properly
varying the experiment, it is found that they really
do so. If a small magnet, freely suspended, be
brought into the neighbourhood of a larger one, it
will take a position depending on the position of the
<em>poles</em> of the larger one, with respect to its point of
suspension. And it has been ascertained that these
and all other phenomena exhibited by magnets in
their mutual attractions and repulsions are explicable
on the supposition of two forces or virtues
lodged in the particles of the magnets, the one
predominating at one end, the other at the other;
and such that each particle shall attract those in
which the <em>opposite</em> virtue to its own prevails, and
repel those in which a <em>similar</em> one resides with a
force proportional to the inverse square of their
mutual distance.</p>

<p>(366.) The direction in which a magnetic bar, or
needle of steel, freely suspended, places itself, has been
ascertained to be different at different points of the
earth’s surface. In some places it points exactly north
and south, in others it deviates from this direction more
or less, and at some actually stands at right angles
to it. This remarkable phenomenon, which is called
the variation of the needle, and which was discovered
by Sebastian Cabot in the year 1500, is accompanied
with another called the dip, noticed by Robert Norman
in 1576. It consists in a tendency of a needle,
nicely balanced on its centre, when unmagnetized,
to <em>dip</em> or point downwards when rendered magnetic,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
towards a point below the horizon, and situated
within the earth. By tracing the variation and dip
over the whole surface of the globe, it has been
found that these phenomena take place as they
would do if the earth itself were a great magnet,
having its poles deeply situated below the surface,—and,
what is very remarkable, possessing a slow
motion within it, in consequence of which neither
the variation nor dip remain constantly the same at
the same place. The laws of this motion are at
present unknown; but the discovery of electro-magnetism,
by rendering it almost certain that the
earth’s magnetism is merely an effect of the continual
circulation of great quantities of electricity
round it, in a direction generally corresponding with
that of its rotation, have dissipated the greater part
of the mystery which hung over these phenomena;
since a variety of causes, both geological and others,
may be imagined which may produce considerable
deviations in the intensity, and partial ones in the
direction, of such electric currents. The unequal
distribution of land and sea in the two hemispheres,
by affecting the operation of the sun’s heat in producing
evaporation from the latter, which is probably
one of the great sources of terrestrial electricity,
may easily be conceived to modify the general tendency
of such currents, and to produce irregularities
in them, which may render a satisfactory account of
whatever still appears anomalous in the phenomena
of terrestrial magnetism. This branch of science
thus becomes connected, on a great scale, with that
of meteorology, one of the most complicated and
difficult, but at the same time interesting, subjects of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
physical research; one, however, which has of late
begun to be studied with a diligence which promises
the speedy disclosure of relations and laws of which
at present we can form but a very imperfect notion.</p>

<p>(367.) The communication of magnetism from the
earth to a magnetic body, or from one magnetic body
to another, is performed by a process to which the
name of induction has been given, and the laws and
properties of such induced magnetism have been
studied with much perseverance and success,—practically,
by Gilbert, Boyle, Knight, Whiston, Cavallo,
Canton, Duhamel, Rittenhouse, Scoresby, and others;
and theoretically, by Æpinus, Coulomb, and Poisson,
and in our own country by Messrs. Barlow and
Christie, who have investigated with great care the
curious phenomena which take place when masses
of iron are presented successively, in different positions,
by rotation on an axis, to the influence of the
earth’s magnetism. The magnetism of crystallized
bodies (partly from the extreme rarity of such as are
susceptible of any considerable magnetic virtue) has
not hitherto been at all examined, but would probably
afford very curious results.</p>

<p>(368.) To electricity the views of the physical
enquirer now turn from almost every quarter, as to
one of those universal powers which Nature seems
to employ in her most important and secret operations.
This wonderful agent, which we see in
intense activity in lightning, and in a feebler and
more diffused form traversing the upper regions of
the atmosphere in the northern lights, is present,
probably in immense abundance, in every form of
matter which surrounds us, but becomes sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
only when disturbed by excitements of peculiar
kinds. The most effectual of these is friction,
which we have already observed to be a powerful
source of heat. Everybody is familiar with the
crackling sparks which fly from a cat’s back when
stroked. These, by proper management, may be
accumulated in bodies suitably disposed to receive
them, and, although then no longer visible, give
evidence of their existence by the exhibition of a vast
variety of extraordinary phenomena,—producing
attractions and repulsions in bodies at a distance,—admitting
of being transferred by contact, or by
sudden and violent transilience of the interval of
separation, from one body to another, under the
form of sparks and flashes;—traversing with perfect
facility the substance of the densest metals, and a
variety of other bodies called conductors, but being
detained by others, such as glass, and especially
<em>air</em>, which are thence called non-conductors,—producing
painful shocks and convulsive motions, and
even death itself if in sufficient quantity, in animals
through which they pass, and finally imitating, on a
small scale, all the effects of lightning.</p>

<p>(369.) The study of these phenomena and their
laws until a comparatively recent period occupied
the entire attention of electricians, and constituted
the whole of the science of electricity. It appears,
as the result of their enquiries, that all the phenomena
in question are explicable on the supposition
that electricity consists in a rare, subtle, and highly
elastic fluid, which in its tendency to expand and
diffuse itself pervades with more or less facility the
substance of conductors, but is obstructed and detained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
from expansion more or less completely by
non-conductors. It is supposed, moreover, that this
electric fluid possesses a power of attraction for the
particles of all ponderable matter, together with
that of a repulsion for particles of its own kind.
Whether it has weight, or is rather to be regarded as
a species of matter distinct from that of which ponderable
bodies consist, is a question of such delicacy,
that no direct experiments have yet enabled us to
decide it; but at all events its <em>inertia</em> compared
with its elastic force must be conceived excessively
small, so that it is to be regarded as a fluid in the
highest degree <em>active</em>, obeying every impulse, internal
or external, with the greatest promptitude;
in short, a fluid whose energies can only be compared
with those of the ethereal medium by which,
in the undulatory doctrine, light is supposed to be
conveyed. The properties of hydrogen gas compared
with those of the denser aëriform fluids will,
in some slight degree, aid our conception of the
excessive mobility and penetrating activity of a
fluid so constituted. Electricity, however, must be
regarded as differing in some remarkable points from
all those fluids to which we have hitherto been accustomed
to apply the epithet elastic, such as air,
gases, and vapours. In these, the repulsive force
of the particles on which their elasticity depends is
considered as extending only to very small distances,
so as to affect only those in the immediate vicinity
of each other, while their attractive power, by
which they obey the general gravitation of all
matter, extends to any distance. In electricity, on
the other hand, the very reverse must be admitted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
The force by which its particles repel each other
extends to great distances, while its force of adhesion
to ponderable matter must be regarded as
limited in its extent to such minute intervals as
escape observation.</p>

<p>(370.) The conception of a single fluid of this
kind, which when accumulated in excess in bodies
tends constantly to escape, and seek a restoration
of equilibrium by communicating itself to any others
where there may be a deficiency, is that which
occurs most naturally to the mind, and was accordingly
maintained by Franklin, to whom the science
of electricity is under great obligations for those
decisive experiments which informed us respecting
the true nature of lightning. The same theory was
afterwards advocated by Æpinus, who first showed
how the laws of equilibrium of such a fluid might
be reduced to strict mathematical investigation.
But there are phenomena accompanying its transfer
from body to body and the state of equilibrium
it affects under various circumstances, which appear
to require the admission of <em>two distinct fluids</em>
antagonist to each other, each attracting the other,
and repelling itself; but each, alike, susceptible of
adhesion to material substances, and of transfer
more or less rapid from particle to particle of them.
These fluids in the natural undisturbed state are
conceived to exist in a state of combination and
mutual saturation; but this combination may be
broken, and either of them separately accumulated
in a body to any amount without the other, provided
its escape be properly obstructed by surrounding
it with non-conductors. When so accumulated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
its repulsion for its own kind and attraction
of the opposite species in neighbouring bodies tends
to disturb the natural equilibrium of the two fluids
present in them, and to produce phenomena of a
peculiar description, which are termed <em>induced</em> electricity.
Curious and artificial as this theory may
appear, there has hitherto been produced no phenomenon
of which it will not afford at least a plausible,
and in by far the majority of cases a very
satisfactory, explanation. It has one character
which is extremely valuable in any theory, that of
admitting the application of strict mathematical
reasoning to the conclusions we would draw from
it. Without this, indeed, it is scarcely possible
that any theory should ever be fairly brought to
the test by a comparison with facts. Accordingly,
the mathematical theory of electrical equilibrium,
and the laws of the distribution of the electric
fluids over the surfaces of bodies in which they
are accumulated, have been made the subject of
elaborate geometrical investigation by the most
expert mathematicians, and have attained a degree
of extent and elegance which places this branch of
science in a very high rank in the scale of mathematico-physical
enquiry. These researches are
grounded on the assumption of a law of attraction
and repulsion similar to those of gravity and magnetism,
and which by the general accordance of
the results with facts, as well as by experiments
instituted for the express purpose of ascertaining
the laws in question, are regarded as sufficiently
demonstrated.</p>

<p>(371.) The most obscure part of the subject is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
doubt the original mode of disturbance of electrical
equilibrium, by which electricity is excited in the
first instance, either by friction or by any other of
those causes which have been ascertained to produce
such an effect: analogies, it is true, are not
wanting<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>; but it must be allowed that hitherto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
nothing decisive has been offered on the subject;
and that conjectural modes of action have in this
instance too often usurped the place of those to
which a careful examination of facts alone can
lead us.</p>

<p>(372.) Philosophers had long been familiar with
the effects of electricity above referred to, and with
those which it produces in its sudden and violent
transfer from one body to another, in rending and
shattering the parts of the substances through which
it passes, and where in great quantity, producing all
the effect of intense heat, igniting, fusing, and volatilizing
metals, and setting fire to inflammable
bodies; even its occasional influence in destroying
or altering the polarity of the magnetic needle
had been noticed: but as heat was known to be
produced by mechanical violence, and as magnetism
was also known to be greatly affected by the
same cause, these effects were referred rather to
that cause than to any thing in the peculiar nature
of the electric matter, and regarded rather as an
indirect consequence of its mode of action than as
connected with its intimate nature. In short, electricity
seemed destined to furnish another in addition
to many instances of subjects insulated from
the rest of philosophy, and capable of being studied
only in its own internal relations, when the great
discoveries of Galvani and Volta placed a new
power at the command of the experimenter, by
whose means those effects which had before been
crowded within an inappreciable instant could be
developed in detail and studied at leisure; and those
forces which had previously exhibited themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
only in a state of uncontrollable intensity were
tamed down, as it were, and made to distribute
their efficacy over an indefinite time, and to regulate
their action at the will of the operator. It was
then soon ascertained that electricity in the act of
its passage along conductors, produces a variety of
wonderful effects, which had never been previously
suspected; and these of such a nature, as to afford
points of contact with several other branches of
physical enquiry, and to throw new and unexpected
lights on some of the most obscure operations of
nature.</p>

<p>(373.) The history of this grand discovery affords
a fine illustration of the advantage to be derived in
physical enquiry from a close and careful attention
to any phenomenon, however apparently trifling,
which may at the moment of observation appear inexplicable
on received principles. The convulsive
motions of a dead frog in the neighbourhood of an
electric discharge, which originally drew Galvani’s
attention to the subject, had been noticed by others
nearly a century before his time, but attracted no
further remark than as indicating a peculiar sensibility
to electrical excitement depending on that
remnant of vitality which is not extinguished in the
organic frame of an animal by the deprivation of
actual life. Galvani was not so satisfied. He analysed
the phenomenon; and in investigating all the
circumstances connected with it was led to the observation
of a peculiar electrical excitement which
took place when a circuit was formed of three distinct
parts, a muscle, a nerve, and a metallic conductor,
each placed in contact with the other two,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
and which was manifested by a convulsive motion
produced in the muscle. To this phenomenon he
gave the name of animal electricity, an unfortunate
epithet, since it tended to restrict enquiry into its
nature to the class of phenomena in which it first
became apparent. But this circumstance, which
in a less enquiring age of science might have exercised
a fatal influence on the progress of knowledge,
proved happily no obstacle to the further developement
of its principles, the subject being immediately
taken up with a kind of prophetic ardour by
Volta, who at once generalized the phenomena, rejecting
the physiological considerations introduced
by Galvani, as foreign to the enquiry, and regarding
the contraction of the muscles as merely a delicate
means of detecting the production of electrical excitements
too feeble to be rendered sensible by any
other means. It was thus that he arrived at the
knowledge of a general fact, that of the disturbance
of electrical equilibrium by the mere contact of different
bodies, and the circulation of a current of
electricity in one constant direction, through a circuit
composed of three different conductors. To
increase the intensity of the very minute and delicate
effect thus observed became his next aim, nor
did his enquiry terminate till it had placed him in
possession of that most wonderful of all human inventions,
the pile which bears his name, through
the medium of a series of well conducted and logically
combined experiments, which has rarely, if
ever, been surpassed in the annals of physical
research.</p>

<p>(374.) Though the original pile of Volta was feeble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
compared to those gigantic combinations which were
afterwards produced, it sufficed, however, to exhibit
electricity under a very different aspect from
any thing which had gone before, and to bring into
view those peculiar modifications in its action which
Dr. Wollaston was the first to render a satisfactory
account of, by referring them to an increase of
<em>quantity</em>, accompanied with a diminution of <em>intensity</em>
in the supply afforded. The discovery had not
long been made public, and the instrument in
the hands of chemists and electricians, before it
was ascertained that the electric current, transmitted
by it through conducting liquids, produces
in them chemical decompositions. This capital discovery
appears to have been made, in the first
instance, by Messrs. Nicholson and Carlisle, who observed
the decomposition of water so produced. It
was speedily followed up by the still more important
one of Berzelius and Hisinger, who ascertained it as
a general law, that, in all the decompositions so
effected, the acids and oxygen become transferred to,
and accumulated around, the positive,—and hydrogen,
metals, and alkalies round the negative, pole of a
Voltaic circuit; being transferred in an invisible, and,
as it were, a latent or torpid state, by the action of
the electric current, through considerable spaces,
and even through large quantities of water or other
liquids, again to re-appear with all their properties
at their appropriate resting-places.</p>

<p>(375.) It was in this state of things that the subject
was taken up by Davy, who, seeing that the strongest
chemical affinities were thus readily subverted by
the decomposing action of the pile, conceived the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
happy idea of bringing to bear the intense power of
the enormous batteries of the Royal Institution on
those substances which, though strongly suspected
to be compounds, had resisted all attempts to decompose
them—the alkalies and earths. They
yielded to the force applied, and a total revolution
was thus effected in chemistry; not so much by the
introduction of the new elements thus brought to
light, as by the mode of conceiving the nature of
chemical affinity, which from that time has been regarded
(as Davy broadly laid it down, in a theory
which was readily adopted by the most eminent
chemists, and by none more readily than by Berzelius
himself,) as entirely due to electric attractions
and repulsions, those bodies combining most intimately
whose particles are habitually in a state of
the most powerful electrical antagonism, and dispossessing
each other, according to the amount of
their difference in this respect.</p>

<p>(376.) The connection of magnetism and electricity
had long been suspected, and innumerable fruitless
trials had been made to determine, in the affirmative
or negative, the question of such connection. The
phenomena of many crystallized minerals which
become electric by heat, and develope opposite
electric poles at their two extremities, offered an
analogy so striking to the polarity of the magnet,
that it seemed hardly possible to doubt a closer
connection of the two powers. The developement
of a similar polarity in the Voltaic pile pointed
strongly to the same conclusion; and experiments
had even been made with a view to ascertain whether
a pile in a state of excitement might not manifest a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
disposition to place itself in the magnetic meridian;
but the essential condition had been omitted, that of
allowing the pile to discharge itself freely, a condition
which assuredly never would have occurred of itself
to any experimenter. Of all the philosophers who
had speculated on this subject, none had so pertinaciously
adhered to the idea of a necessary connection
between the phenomena as Oërsted. Baffled often,
he returned to the attack; and his perseverance was
at length rewarded by the complete disclosure of the
wonderful phenomena of electro-magnetism. There
is something in this which reminds us of the obstinate
adherence of Columbus to his notion of the
necessary existence of the New World; and the
whole history of this beautiful discovery may serve
to teach us reliance on those general analogies and
parallels between great branches of science by which
one strongly reminds us of another, though no direct
connection appears; as an indication not to be neglected
of a community of origin.</p>

<p>(377.) It is highly probable that we are still
ignorant of many interesting features in electrical
science, which the study of the Voltaic circuit will
one day disclose. The violent mechanical effects
produced by it on mercury, placed under conducting
liquids which have been referred by Professor
Erman to a modified form of capillary attraction,
but which a careful and extended view of the phenomena
have led others<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> to regard in a very different
light, as pointing out a primary action of a
dynamical rather than a statical character, deserve,
in this point of view, a further investigation; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
the curious relations of electricity to heat, as exhibited
in the phenomena of what has been called
thermo-electricity, promise an ample supply of new
information.</p>

<p>(378.) Among the remarkable effects of electricity
disclosed by the researches of Galvani and Volta,
perhaps the most so consisted in its influence on
the nervous system of animals. The origin of muscular
motion is one of those profound mysteries of
nature which we can scarcely venture to hope will
ever be fully explained. Physiologists, however,
had long entertained a general conception of the
conveyance of some subtle fluid or spirit from the
brain to the muscles of animals along the nerves;
and the discovery of the rapid transmission of electricity
along conductors, with the violent effects
produced by shocks, transmitted through the body,
on the nervous system, would very naturally lead to
the idea that this nervous fluid, if it had any real
existence, might be no other than the electrical.
But until the discoveries of Galvani and Volta, this
could only be looked upon as a vague conjecture.
The character of a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vera causa</i> was wanting to give it
any degree of rational plausibility, since no reason
could be imagined for the disturbance of the electrical
equilibrium in the animal frame, composed as it is
entirely of conductors, or rather, it seemed contrary
to the then known laws of electrical communication
to suppose any such. Yet one strange and surprising
phenomenon might be adduced indicative of the
possibility of such disturbance, viz. the powerful
shock given by the torpedo and other fishes of the
same kind, which presented so many analogies with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
those arising from electricity, that they could hardly
be referred to a different source, though <em>besides</em> the
shock neither spark nor any other indication of electrical
tension could be detected in them.</p>

<p>(379.) The benumbing effect of the torpedo had
been ascertained to depend on certain singularly constructed
organs composed of membranous columns,
filled from end to end with laminæ, separated
from each other by a fluid: but of its mode of
action no satisfactory account could be given;
nor was there any thing in its construction, and
still less in the nature of its materials, to give
the least ground for supposing it an electrical apparatus.
But the pile of Volta supplied at once the
analogies both of structure and of effect, so as to
leave little doubt of the electrical nature of the apparatus,
or of the power, a most wonderful one
certainly, of the animal, to determine, by an effort
of its will, that concurrence of conditions on which
its activity depends. This remained, as it probably
ever will remain, mysterious and inexplicable; but
the principle once established, that there exists in
the animal economy a power of determining the
developement of electric excitement, capable of being
transmitted along the nerves, and it being ascertained,
by numerous and decisive experiments,
that the transmission of Voltaic electricity along the
nerves of even a dead animal is sufficient to produce
the most violent muscular action, it became an easy
step to refer the origin of muscular motion in the living
frame to a similar cause; and to look to the brain,
a wonderfully constituted organ, for which no mode
of action possessing the least plausibility had ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
been devised, as the source of the required electrical
power.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>(380.) It is not our intention, however, to enter
into any further consideration of physiological subjects.
They form, it is true, a most important and
deeply interesting province of philosophical enquiry;
but the view that we have taken of physical science
has rather been directed to the study of inanimate
nature, than to that of the mysterious phenomena
of organization and life, which constitute the object
of physiology. The history of the animal and
vegetable productions of the globe, as affording
objects and materials for the convenience and use
of man, and as dependent on and indicative of the
general laws which determine the distribution of
heat, moisture, and other natural agents, over its
surface, and the revolutions it has undergone, are of
course intimately connected with our subject, and
will, therefore, naturally afford room for some remarks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
but not such as will long detain the reader’s
attention.</p>

<p>(381.) In <em>zoology</em>, the connection of peculiar modes
of life and food, with peculiarities of structure, has
given rise to systems of classification at once obvious
and natural; and the great progress which
has been made in comparative anatomy has enabled
us to trace a graduated scale of organization almost
through the whole chain of animal being; a scale
not without its intervals, but which every successive
discovery of animals heretofore unknown has tended
to fill up. The wonders disclosed by microscopic
observation have opened to us a new world, in
which we discover, with astonishment, the extremes
of minuteness and complexity of structure united;
while, on the other hand, the examination of the
fossil remains of a former state of creation has
demonstrated the existence of animals far surpassing
in magnitude those now living, and brought to light
many forms of being which have nothing analogous
to them at present, and many others which afford
important connecting links between existing genera.
And, on the other hand, the researches of the comparative
anatomist and conchologist have thrown
the greatest light on the studies of the geologist,
and enabled him to discern, through the obscure
medium of a few relics, scattered here and there
through a stratum, circumstances connected with
the formation of the stratum itself which he could
have recognised by no other indication. This is one
among many striking instances of the unexpected
lights which sciences, however apparently remote,
may throw upon each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
(382.) To <em>botany</em> many of the same remarks apply.
Its artificial systems of classification, however convenient,
have not prevented botanists from endeavouring
to group together the objects of their
science in natural classes having a community of
character more intimate than those which determine
their place in the Linnean or any similar
system; a community of character extending over
the whole habit and properties of the individuals
compared. The important chemical discoveries
which have been lately made of peculiar proximate
principles which, in an especial manner, characterize
certain families of plants, hold out the prospect of a
greatly increased field of interesting knowledge in
this direction, and not only interesting, but in a
high degree important, when it is considered that
the principles thus brought into view are, for the
most part, very powerful medicines, and are, in fact,
the essential ingredients on which the medical
virtues of the plants depend. The law of the distribution
of the generic forms of plants over the
globe, too, has, within a comparatively recent period,
become an object of study to the naturalist; and its
connection with the laws of climate constitutes one
of the most interesting and important branches of
natural-historical enquiry, and one on which great
light remains to be thrown by future researches.
It is this which constitutes the chief connecting
link between botany and geology, and renders a
knowledge of the vegetable fossils, of any portion of
the earth’s surface, indispensable to the formation
of a correct judgment of the circumstances under
which it existed in its ancient state. Fossil botany<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
is accordingly cultivated with great and increasing
ardour; and the subterraneous “Flora” of a geological
formation is, in many instances, studied with
a degree of care and precision little inferior to that
which its surface exhibits.</p>

<p class="center b2">OF THE CAUSES OF THE ACTUAL RAPID ADVANCE OF THE
PHYSICAL SCIENCES COMPARED WITH THEIR PROGRESS
AT AN EARLIER PERIOD.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">(383.) <span class="smcap"><span class="flet">T</span>here</span> is no more extraordinary contrast than
that presented by the slow progress of the physical
sciences, from the earliest ages of the world to the
close of the sixteenth century, and the rapid developement
they have since experienced. In the
former period of their history, we find only small
additions to the stock of knowledge, made at long
intervals of time; during which a total indifference
on the part of the mass of mankind to the study of
nature operated to effect an almost complete oblivion
of former discoveries, or, at best, permitted them to
linger on record, rather as literary curiosities, than
as possessing, in themselves, any intrinsic interest
and importance. A few enquiring individuals, from
age to age, might perceive their value, and might
feel that irrepressible thirst after knowledge which,
in minds of the highest order, supplies the absence
both of external stimulus and opportunity. But the
total want of a right direction given to enquiry, and
of a clear perception of the objects to be aimed
at, and the advantages to be gained by systematic
and connected research, together with the general
apathy of society to speculations remote from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
ordinary affairs of life, and studiously kept involved
in learned mystery, effectually prevented these occasional
impulses from overcoming the inertia of
ignorance, and impressing any regular and steady
progress on science. Its objects, indeed, were confined
in a region too sublime for vulgar comprehension.
An earthquake, a comet, or a fiery meteor,
would now and then call the attention of the whole
world, and produce from all quarters a plentiful
supply of crude and fanciful conjectures on their
causes; but it was never supposed that sciences
could exist among common objects, have a place
among mechanical arts, or find worthy matter of
speculation in the mine or the laboratory. Yet it
cannot be supposed, that all the indications of nature
continually passed unremarked, or that much good
observation and shrewd reasoning on it failed to
perish unrecorded, before the invention of printing
enabled every one to make his ideas known to all
the world. The moment this took place, however,
the sparks of information from time to time struck
out, instead of glimmering for a moment, and dying
away in oblivion, began to accumulate into a genial
glow, and the flame was at length kindled which
was speedily to acquire the strength and rapid spread
of a conflagration. The universal excitement in the
minds of men throughout Europe, which the first
out-break of modern science produced, has been
already spoken of. But even the most sanguine
anticipators could scarcely have looked forward to
that steady, unintermitted progress which it has
since maintained, nor to that rapid succession of
great discoveries which has kept up the interest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the first impulse still vigorous and undiminished. It
may truly, indeed, be said, that there is scarcely a
single branch of physical enquiry which is either
stationary, or which has not been, for many years
past, in a constant state of advance, and in which
the progress is not, at this moment, going on with
accelerated rapidity.</p>

<p>(384.) Among the causes of this happy and desirable
state of things, no doubt we are to look, in the
first instance, to that great increase in wealth and civilization
which has at once afforded the necessary
leisure and diffused the taste for intellectual pursuits
among numbers of mankind, which have long been
and still continue steadily progressive in every principal
European state, and which the increase and fresh
establishment of civilized communities in every distant
region are rapidly spreading over the whole
globe. It is not, however, merely the increased
number of cultivators of science, but their enlarged
opportunities, that we have here to consider, which,
in all those numerous departments of natural research
that require local information, is in fact the
most important consideration of all. To this cause
we must trace the great extension which has of late
years been conferred on every branch of natural
history, and the immense contributions which have
been made, and are daily making, to the departments
of zoology and botany, in all their ramifications.
It is obvious, too, that all the information
that can possibly be procured, and reported, by the
most enlightened and active travellers, must fall
infinitely short of what is to be obtained by individuals
actually resident upon the spot. Travellers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
indeed, may make collections, may snatch a few
hasty observations, may note, for instance, the distribution
of geological formations in a few detached
points, and now and then witness remarkable local
phenomena; but the resident alone can make continued
series of regular observations, such as the
scientific determination of climates, tides, magnetic
variations, and innumerable other objects of that
kind, requires; can alone mark all the details of
geological structure, and refer each stratum, by a
careful and long continued observation of its fossil
contents, to its true epoch; can alone note the habits
of the animals of his country, and the limits of its
vegetation, or obtain a satisfactory knowledge of its
mineral contents, with a thousand other particulars
essential to that complete acquaintance with our
globe as a whole, which is beginning to be understood
by the extensive designation of physical geography.
Besides which, ought not to be omitted
multiplied opportunities of observing and recording
those extraordinary phenomena of nature which
offer an intense interest, from the rarity of their occurrence
as well as the instruction they are calculated
to afford. To what, then, may we not look
forward, when a spirit of scientific enquiry shall have
spread through those vast regions in which the process
of civilization, its sure precursor, is actually
commenced and in active progress? And what may
we not expect from the exertions of powerful minds
called into action under circumstances totally different
from any which have yet existed in the world,
and over an extent of territory far surpassing that
which has hitherto produced the whole harvest of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
human intellect? In proportion as the number of
those who are engaged on each department of physical
enquiry increases, and the geographical extent
over which they are spread is enlarged, a proportionately
increased facility of communication and
interchange of knowledge becomes essential to the
prosecution of their researches with full advantage.
Not only is this desirable, to prevent a number of
individuals from making the same discoveries at the
same moment, which (besides the waste of valuable
time) has always been a fertile source of jealousies
and misunderstandings, by which great evils have
been entailed on science; but because methods of
observation are continually undergoing new improvements,
or acquiring new facilities, a knowledge
of which, it is for the general interest of science,
should be diffused as widely and as rapidly as possible.
By this means, too, a sense of common interest, of
mutual assistance, and a feeling of sympathy in a
common pursuit, are generated, which proves a
powerful stimulus to exertion; and, on the other
hand, means are thereby afforded of detecting and
pointing out mistakes before it is too late for their
rectification.</p>

<p>(385.) Perhaps it may be truly remarked, that, next
to the establishment of institutions having either the
promotion of science in general, or, what is still more
practically efficacious in its present advanced state,
that of particular departments of physical enquiry,
for their express objects, nothing has exercised so
powerful an influence on the progress of modern
science as the publication of monthly and quarterly
scientific journals, of which there is now scarcely a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
nation in Europe which does not produce several.
The quick and universal circulation of these, places
observers of all countries on the same level of perfect
intimacy with each other’s objects and methods,
while the abstracts they from time to time (if well
conducted) contain of the most important researches
of the day consigned to the more ponderous tomes
of academical collections, serve to direct the course
of general observation, as well as to hold out, in the
most conspicuous manner, models for emulative
imitation. In looking forward to what may hereafter
be expected from this cause of improvement, we are
not to forget the powerful effect which must in
future be produced by the spread of elementary
works and digests of what is actually known in each
particular branch of science. Nothing can be more
discouraging to one engaged in active research, than
the impression that all he is doing may, very likely,
be labour taken in vain; that it may, perhaps, have
been already done, and much better done, than, with
his opportunities, or his resources, he can hope to
perform it; and, on the other hand, nothing can be
more exciting than the contrary impression. Thus,
by giving a connected view of what has been done,
and what remains to be accomplished in every
branch, those digests and bodies of science, which
from time to time appear, have, in fact, a very important
weight in determining its future progress, quite
independent of the quantity of information they
communicate. With respect to elementary treatises,
it is needless to point out their utility, or to dwell
on the influence which their actual abundance, contrasted
with their past remarkable deficiency, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
likely to exercise over the future. It is only by
condensing, simplifying, and arranging, in the most
lucid possible manner, the acquired knowledge of
past generations, that those to come can be enabled
to avail themselves to the full of the advanced point
from which they will start.</p>

<p>(386.) One of the means by which an advanced state
of physical science contributes greatly to accelerate
and secure its further progress, is the exact knowledge
acquired of physical data, or those normal
quantities which we have more than once spoken
of in the preceding pages (222.); a knowledge
which enables us not only to appretiate the accuracy
of experiments, but even to correct their results.
As there is no surer criterion of the state of science
in any age than the degree of care bestowed, and
discernment exhibited, in the choice of such data, so
as to afford the simplest possible grounds for the application
of theories, and the degree of accuracy
attained in their determination, so there is scarcely
any thing by which science can be more truly benefited
than by researches directed expressly to this
object, and to the construction of tables exhibiting
the true numerical relations of the elements of
theories, and the actual state of nature, in all its different
branches. It is only by such determinations
that we can ascertain what changes are slowly and
imperceptibly taking place in the existing order
of things; and the more accurate they are, the <em>sooner</em>
will this knowledge be acquired. What might we
not now have known of the motions of the (so-called)
fixed stars, had the ancients possessed the means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
observation we now possess, and employed them as
we employ them now?</p>

<p>(387.) In any enumeration of causes which have
contributed to the recent rapid advancement of
science, we must not forget the very important one
of improved and constantly improving means of
observation, both in instruments adapted for the
exact measurement of quantity, and in the general
convenience and well-judged adaptation to its purposes,
of every description of scientific apparatus.
In the actual state of science there are few observations
which can be productive of any great advantage
but such as afford accurate measurement; and an
increased refinement in this respect is constantly
called for. The degree of delicacy actually attained,
we will not say in the most elaborate works of the
highest art, but in such ordinary apparatus as every
observer may now command, is such as could not
have been arrived at unless in a state of the mechanical
arts, which in its turn (such is the mutual
re-action of cause and effect) requires for its existence
a very advanced state of science. What an important
influence may be exercised over the progress
of a single branch of science by the invention of a
ready and convenient mode of executing a definite
measurement, and the construction and common
introduction of an instrument adapted for it cannot
be better exemplified than by the instance of the
reflecting goniometer. This simple, cheap, and
portable little instrument, has changed the face of
mineralogy, and given it all the characters of one
of the exact sciences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
(388.) Our means of perceiving and measuring minute
quantities, in the important relations of weight,
space, and time, seem already to have been carried
to a point which it is hardly conceivable they should
surpass. Balances have been constructed which
have rendered sensible the millionth part of the
whole quantity weighed; and to turn with the
thousandth part of a grain is the performance of balances
pretending to no very extraordinary degree of
merit. The elegant invention of the sphærometer,
by substituting the sense of touch for that of sight in
the measurement of minute objects, permits the
determination of their dimensions with a degree of
precision which is fully adequate to the nicest purposes
of scientific enquiry. By its aid an inch may
be readily subdivided into ten or even twenty thousand
parts; and the lever of contact, an instrument
in use among the German opticians, enables us to
appretiate quantities of space even yet smaller.
For the subdivision of time, too, the perfection of
modern mechanism has furnished resources which
leave very little to be desired. By the aid of clocks
and chronometers, as they are now constructed, a
few tenths of a second is all the error that need
be apprehended in the subdivision of a day; and
for the further subdivision of smaller portions of
time, instruments have been imagined which admit
of almost unlimited precision, and permit us to appreciate
intervals to the nicety of the hundredth, or
even the thousandth part of a single second.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
When the precision attainable by such means is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
contrasted with what could be procured a few generations
ago, by the rude and clumsy workmanship
of even the early part of the last century, it will be
no matter of astonishment that the sciences which
depend on exact measurements should have made
a proportional progress. Nor will any degree of
nicety in physical determinations appear beyond our
reach, if we consider the inexhaustible resources
which science itself furnishes, in rendering the
quantities actually to be determined by measure
great multiples of the elements required for the
purposes of theory, so as to diminish in the same
proportion the influence of any errors which may be
committed on the final results.</p>

<p>(389.) Great, indeed, as have been of late the improvements
in the construction of instruments, both
as to what regards convenience and accuracy, it is to
the discovery of improved <em>methods</em> of observation that
the chief progress of those parts of science which depend
on exact determinations is owing. The balance
of torsion, the ingenious invention of Cavendish and
Coulomb, may be cited as an example of what we
mean. By its aid we are enabled not merely to render
sensible, but to subject to precise measurement and
subdivision, degrees of force infinitely too feeble
to affect the nicest balance of the usual construction,
even were it possible to bring them to act on it.
The galvanometer, too, affords another example of
the same kind, in an instrument whose range of
utility lies among electric forces which we have no
other means of rendering sensible, much less of
estimating with exactness. In determinations of
quantities less minute in themselves, the methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
devised by Messrs. Arago and Fresnel, for the
measurement of the refractive powers of transparent
media by means of the phenomenon of diffraction,
may be cited as affording a degree of precision
limited only by the wishes of the observer, and the
time and patience he is willing to devote to his
observation. And in respect of the direction of
observations to points from which real information
is to be obtained, and positive conclusions drawn,
the hygrometer of Daniell may be cited as an
elegant example of the introduction into general use
of an instrument substituting an indication founded
on strict principles for one perfectly arbitrary.</p>

<p>(390.) In speculating on the future prospects of
physical science, we should not be justified in leaving
out of consideration the probability, or rather
certainty, of the occasional occurrence of those happy
accidents which have had so powerful an influence
on the past; occasions, where a fortunate combination
opportunely noticed may admit us in an instant
to the knowledge of principles of which no
suspicion might occur but for some such casual
notice. Boyle has entitled one of his essays thus remarkably,—“<cite>Of
Man’s great Ignorance of the Uses of
natural Things; or that there is no one Thing in Nature
whereof the Uses to human Life are yet thoroughly
understood</cite>.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The whole history of the arts since
Boyle’s time has been one continued comment on
this text; and if we regard among the uses of the
works of nature, <em>that</em>, assuredly the noblest of all,
which leads us to a knowledge of the Author of
nature through the contemplation of the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
means by which he has wrought out his purposes
in his works, the sciences have not been behind
hand in affording their testimony to its truth.
Nor are we to suppose that the field is in the
slightest degree narrowed, or the chances in favour
of such fortunate discoveries at all decreased, by
those which have already taken place: on the
contrary, they have been incalculably extended.
It is true that the ordinary phenomena which pass
before our eyes have been minutely examined, and
those more striking and obvious principles which
occur to superficial observation have been noticed
and embodied in our systems of science; but, not
to mention that by far the greater part of natural
phenomena remain yet unexplained, every
new discovery in science brings into view whole
classes of facts which would never otherwise have
fallen under our notice at all, and establishes relations
which afford to the philosophic mind a constantly
extending field of speculation, in ranging
over which it is next to impossible that he should
not encounter new and unexpected principles. How
infinitely greater, for instance, are the mere chances
of discovery in chemistry among the innumerable
combinations with which the modern chemist is
familiar, than at a period when two or three imaginary
elements, and some ten or twenty substances,
whose properties were known with an approach to
distinctness, formed the narrow circle within which
his ideas had to revolve? How many are the instances
where a new substance, or a new property,
introduced into familiar use, by being thus brought
into relation with all our actual elements of knowledge,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
has become the means of developing properties
and principles among the most common objects,
which could never have otherwise been discovered?
Had not platina (to take an instance) been an object
of the most ordinary occurrence in a laboratory, would
a suspicion have ever occurred that a lamp could be
constructed to burn without flame; and should we
have ever arrived at a knowledge of those curious
phenomena and products of semi-combustion which
this beautiful experiment discloses?</p>

<p>(391.) Finally, when we look back on what has been
accomplished in science, and compare it with what
remains to be done, it is hardly possible to avoid
being strongly impressed with the idea that we have
been and are still executing the labour by which
succeeding generations are to profit.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> In a few instances
only have we arrived at those general
axiomatic laws which admit of direct deductive
inference, and place the solutions of physical phenomena
before us as so many problems, whose principles
of solution we fully possess, and which require
nothing but acuteness of reasoning to pursue even
into their farthest recesses. In fewer still have we
reached that command of abstract reasoning itself
which is necessary for the accomplishment of so
arduous a task. Science, therefore, in relation to
our faculties, still remains boundless and unexplored,
and, after the lapse of a century and a half from the
æra of Newton’s discoveries, during which every
department of it has been cultivated with a zeal and
energy which have assuredly met their full return,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
we remain in the situation in which he figured himself,—standing
on the shore of a wide ocean, from
whose beach we may have culled some of those innumerable
beautiful productions it casts up with lavish
prodigality, but whose acquisition can be regarded as
no diminution of the treasures that remain.</p>

<p>(392.) But this consideration, so far from repressing
our efforts, or rendering us hopeless of attaining any
thing intrinsically great, ought rather to excite us to
fresh enterprise, by the prospect of assured and ample
recompense from that inexhaustible store which only
awaits our continued endeavours. “It is no detraction
from human capacity to suppose it incapable of
infinite exertion, or of exhausting an infinite subject.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
In whatever state of knowledge we may conceive
man to be placed, his progress towards a
yet higher state need never fear a check, but must
continue till the last existence of society.</p>

<p>(393.) It is in this respect an advantageous view
of science, which refers all its advances to the discovery
of general laws, and to the inclusion of what
is already known in generalizations of still higher
orders; inasmuch as this view of the subject represents
it, as it really is, essentially incomplete, and
incapable of being fully embodied in any system, or
embraced by any single mind. Yet it must be recollected
that, so far as our experience has hitherto
gone, every advance towards generality has at the
same time been a step towards simplification. It is
only when we are wandering and lost in the mazes
of particulars, or entangled in fruitless attempts to
work our way downwards in the thorny paths of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
applications, to which our reasoning powers are incompetent,
that nature appears complicated:—the
moment we contemplate it as it is, and attain a position
from which we can take a commanding view,
though but of a small part of its plan, we never fail to
recognise that sublime simplicity on which the mind
rests satisfied that it has attained the truth.</p>

one of the most profound but at the same time popular writers
of our time, on a subject unconnected it is true with our own,
but bearing strongly on the point before us. “But, if science
be manifestly incomplete, and yet of the highest importance,
it would surely be most unwise to restrain enquiry, conducted
on just principles, even where the immediate practical utility
of it was not visible. In mathematics, chemistry, and every
branch of natural philosophy, how many are the enquiries
necessary for their improvement and completion, which, taken
separately, do not appear to lead to any specifically advantageous
purpose! how many useful inventions, and how much
valuable and improving knowledge, would have been lost, if a
rational curiosity, and a mere love of information, had not
generally been allowed to be a sufficient motive for the search
after truth!”—Malthus’s Principles of Political Economy,

Pascoe Thomas, Lond. 1745, So tremendous were the ravages
of scurvy, that, in the year 1726, admiral Hosier sailed with
seven ships of the line to the West Indies, and buried his ships’
companies twice, and died himself in consequence of a broken
heart. Dr. Johnson, in the year 1778, could describe a sea-life
in such terms as these:—“As to the sailor, when you look
down from the quarter deck to the space below, you see the
utmost extremity of human misery, such crowding, such filth,
such stench!”—“A ship is a prison with the chance of being
drowned—it is worse—worse in every respect—worse room,
worse air, worse food—worse company!” Smollet, who had
personal experience of the horrors of a seafaring life in those
days, gives a lively picture of them in his Roderick Random.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Lemon juice was known to be a remedy for scurvy far
superior to all others 200 years ago, as appears by the
writings of Woodall. His work is entitled “The Surgeon’s
Mate, or Military and Domestic Medicine. By John Woodall,
Master in Surgery London, 1636,” p. 165. In 1600, Commodore
Lancaster sailed from England with three other ships
for the Cape of Good Hope, on the 2d of April, and arrived
in Saldanha Bay on the 1st of August, the commodore’s own
ship being in perfect health, from the administration of three
table-spoonsfull of lemon juice every morning to each of his
men, whereas the other ships were so sickly as to be unmanageable
for want of hands, and the commander was obliged
to send men on board to take in their sails and hoist out their
boats. (Purchas’s Pilgrim, vol. i. p. 149.) A Fellow of the
college, and an eminent practitioner, in 1753 published a tract
on sea scurvy, in which he adverts to the superior virtue of this
medicine; and Mr. A. Baird, surgeon of the Hector sloop of
war, states, that from what he had seen of its effects on
board of that ship, he “thinks he shall not be accused of
presumption in pronouncing it, if properly administered, a
<em>most infallible remedy</em>, both in the cure and prevention of
scurvy.” (Vide Trotter’s Medicina Nautica.) The precautions
adopted by captain Cook in his celebrated voyages, had fully
demonstrated by their complete success the practicability of
keeping scurvy under in the longest voyages, but a uniform
system of prevention throughout the service was still deficient.
</p>
<p>
It is to the representations of Dr. Blair and sir Gilbert
Blane, in their capacity of commissioners of the board for sick
and wounded seamen, in 1795, we believe, that its <em>systematic
introduction into nautical diet</em>, by a general order of the admiralty,
is owing. The effect of this wise measure (taken, of
course, in conjunction with the general causes of improved
health,) may be estimated from the following facts:—In
1780, the number of cases of scurvy received into Haslar
hospital was 1457; in 1806 <em>one</em> only, and in 1807 <em>one</em>. There
are now many surgeons in the navy who have never seen the
disease.</p></div>

Of mercurial preparations the physicians of his time were ignorant,

who imposed on it that name, “because it contains the water,
the salt, the oil, and the acid, which burn the patient as hell

fact should be publicly recorded, and its memory preserved by an
inscription. Indeed, how much valuable and useful information
of the actual existing state of arts and knowledge at any
period might be transmitted to posterity in a distinct, tangible,
and imperishable form, if, instead of the absurd and useless
deposition of a few coins and medals under the foundations
of buildings, specimens of ingenious implements or
condensed statements of scientific truths, or processes in arts

preserve to a remote posterity all that we may desire should be

in a philosophical point of view, of natural and artificial
systems of classification in general, though limited in its
expression to his own immediate science:—“After all that
has been effected, or is likely to be accomplished hereafter,
there will always be more difficulty in acquiring a knowledge
of the natural system of botany than of the Linnæan. The
latter skims only the surface of things, and leaves the student
in the fancied possession of a sort of information which it is
easy enough to obtain, but which is of little value when acquired:
the former requires a minute investigation of every
part and every property known to exist in plants; but when
understood has conveyed to the mind a store of real information,
of the utmost use to man in every station of life. Whatever
the difficulties may be of becoming acquainted with plants
according to this method, they are inseparable from botany,
which cannot be usefully studied without encountering them.”

seen noticed elsewhere in the case of a disturbance of the equilibrium
of heat produced by means purely mechanical, and by
a process depending entirely on a certain order and sequence

of air enclosed in a metallic reservoir, of some good conductor
of heat, and suddenly compressed by a piston. After
giving time for the heat developed by the condensation to be
communicated from the air to the metal which will be thereby
more or less raised in temperature <em>above</em> the surrounding atmosphere,
let the piston be suddenly retracted and the air restored
to its original volume in an instant. The whole apparatus is
now precisely in its initial situation, as to the disposition of its
material parts, and the whole quantity of heat it contains remains
unchanged. But it is evident that the distribution of
this heat within it is now very different from what it was before;
for the air in its sudden expansion cannot re-absorb in an instant
of time all the heat it had parted with to the metal: it
will, therefore, have a temperature <em>below</em> that of the general
atmosphere, while the metal yet retains one above it. Thus,
a subversion of the equilibrium of temperature has been <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bonâ
fide</i> effected. Heat has been driven from the air into the
metal, while every thing else remains unchanged.
</p>
<p>
We have here a means by which, it is evident, heat may be
obtained, to any extent, from the air, without fuel. For if, in
place of withdrawing the piston and letting the <em>same</em> air expand,
within the reservoir, it be allowed to escape so suddenly
as not to re-absorb the heat given off, and fresh air be then admitted
and the process repeated, any quantity of air may thus
be <em>drained</em> of its heat.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> If the brain be an electric pile, constantly in action, it
may be conceived to discharge itself at regular intervals, when
the tension of the electricity developed reaches a certain point,
along the nerves which communicate with the heart, and thus
to excite the pulsations of that organ. This idea is forcibly
suggested by a view of that elegant apparatus, the dry pile of
Deluc; in which the successive accumulations of electricity
are carried off by a suspended ball, which is kept by the discharges
in a state of regular pulsation for any length of time.
We have witnessed the action of such a pile maintained in this
way for whole years in the study of the above-named eminent
philosopher. The same idea of the cause of the pulsation of
the heart appears to have occurred to Dr. Arnott; and is mentioned
in his useful and excellent work on physics, to which
however, we are not indebted for the suggestion, it having
occurred to us independently many years ago.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
